The accused was not charged with an offence punishable underSection,"(1901)ILR 24MAD675JUDGMENT1. Certain witnesses made statements in a preliminary enquiry into a murder case before a Magistrate and contradicted these statements at the trial before the Sessions Court of South Arcot. The Sessions Court then sanctioned their prosecution for offences punishable underSection 193, Indian Penal Code, in that they had made contradictory statements, both on oath, one or other of which must necessarily be false. They were accordingly convicted by the Deputy Magistrate of an offence punishable under that section for having given false evidence by making statements, one or other of which must have been false. The Deputy Magistrate took no evidence to show which of the two statements was false and recorded no finding on that point. The accused appealed to the Sessions Court of South Arcot, and their appeals were transferred to the Sessions Judge of Chingleput who on hearing the appeals, came to the conclusion that the statements made by the appellant at the preliminary enquiry were probably false, and as the case was one of murder, he held that the offence committed by the appellants was probably, one punishable underSection 194, Indian Penal Code, and was therefore triable exclusively by the Court of Session and not by a Magistrate of the first",King-Emperor,Ayyan And Vellayappa Udayan,"193, 194, 194and, 195, 379, 392, 392and, 392as, 392was, 394, 394and, 394became, 394was, 397, 397is, 403, 530","Take notes as you read a judgment using ourVirtual Legal Assistantand get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).
