Report bearing crime No.RCI(A)/90/ACU-IV registered against certain unnamed persons and three named persons, namely, S/Shri Martin Ardgo, former President of Bofors A.B. (for short called 'Bofors'), G.P.Hinduja of London and the petitioner W.N. Chadha @ Win Chadha alleging commission of offences under sections 120B read withSections 161,162,163,164and165Aof the Indian Penal Code read withsections 5(2)/5(l)(d)and5(2)/5(l)(c)of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read withsections 409,420,463and471of the Indian Penal Code. In the writ petition the petitioner, inter alia, has prayed for quashing of the aforesaid First Information Report and the proceedings and the orders passed thereon and arising there from including the letter rogatory issued by the Special Judge, Delhi. The facts of the case briefly stated are that the petitioner, who is a citizen of India and is residing and working for gain at Dubai had arrangement with Bofors of Sweden to provide representation services to it in India with regard to supply of arms and ammunition and had been charging commission for the services rendered by him in terms of service agreement executed between the said Company and the petitioner from time to time till the end of 1985.(2) However, in January 1986 Bofors and Anatronic General Corporation Private Ltd., (for short called 'AGC') a Company promoted by the petitioner entered into an administrative consultancy agreement with Bofors in respect of its business in India. In terms of the said agreement of 1986, the petitioner through his Company was to render administrative consultancy services to Bofors in India and he was to charge Sek 1 lakh per month for these services. The petitioner was not entitled to enter into negotiation with the Government of India on behalf of Bofors or to commit on behalf of Bofors to any agreement or appointment as he was required to render ony administrative consultancy services. In April 1984 the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs ( for short called 'CCPA') approved the proposal for procurement of 155 Mm guns along with certain related equipments and ammunition at a total estimated cost of Rs.l6 crores and their subsequent licensed manufacture in India. In May 1984 a Negotiation Committee comprising of the defense Secretary as the Chairman, Secretary (DP&S), Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri (i.e. Secretary R&D), Secretary (Expenditure), Additional Secretary (Department of Economic Affairs), Financial Adviser (defense Services) and the Deputy Chief of Army Staff as members was constituted for detailed negotiations with the various suppliers.(3) The Negotiating Committee started its deliberations in June 1984 and decided that fresh sealed technical and commercial offers should be invited from p:3 the four firms, Ims of U.K., Sofma of France, Bofors of Sweden and Voest Alpine of Austria. After the offers were received from the aforesaid four firms, technical and commercial negotiations were held with all the said Firms and thereafter revised offers were invited and the same were received on 1st September, 1984. Offers were also invited from the ammunition manufacturers. After certain clarifications were sought from the aforesaid firms with a view to evaluate the offers of all the competitors, all the four firms submitted fresh commercial offers on 10th May, 1985. Thereafter members of the Negotiating Committee requested the Army Headquarters to give their categorical recommendation on the guns acceptable to them taking into account the technical aspects, delivery schedule etc., and also clearly indicate their preference from amongst the acceptable guns. The then Deputy Chief of Army Staff told the Committee that the French gun was the best and the Swedish gun the second best and if the price difference was marginal, they should go in for the former.(4) The recommendations of the Army Headquarters to shortlist only M/s. Sofma, France and M/s. Bofors, Sweden for further negotiations were accepted by the Negotiating Committee which, however, felt that the choice between the two was still open and would depend on a combination of technical and Financial considerations.(5) The two firms on the shortlist mentioned hereinabove were called for negotiation in the middle of December 1985 and the three ammunition manufacturers in the middle of January 1986. The Commercial, contractual and technical aspects of purchase and license production were negotiated with the said two firms. The Negotiating Committee in their silting on 4th March, 1986 noted that while Army Headquarters had found that both the guns met the minimum acceptable parameters, they had expressed the view that the Bofors gun had a clear edge over the Sofma gun. The then Deputy Chief of Army Staff also expressed the view that because of the advantages noted in the Bofors guns, this gun should be procured even if it involved paying more.(6) In the meeting held on 12th March, 1986 the Negotiating Committee noted that Bofors had offered increased credit for the supply of components for the indigenous manufacture of the gun system under license and it had also reduced (he interest rate on D M credit. The Committee felt that keeping in view the technical, contractual and financial aspects, the offer of M/s. Bofors was the better of the two. It recommended, that pending Finishing touches to the contracts, a letter of intent may be issued to M/s. Bofors to the effect that Government would be willing to award the contract to them subject to being satisfied on all aspects of the purchase, licensed production, credit and other arrangements.(7) As is evident from the records, the Negotiating Committee received several different offers for the total package from the two short listed firms from January lo March 1986. In this connection it will be relevant to reproduce a statement showing the comparative prices offered from lime to time by these two firms during this period, which has been taken from the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (for short called 'JPC'). The statement is as follows:-     DATE4 Sek & RS. & Millions 4 & Crorks 1-03-2-86 9872.195 1587.15 10-2-86 9652.510 1619.59 21-2-86 8762.868 1470.32 11-3-86 8456.906 1418.98 & 1449.72 21-3-86 8348.071 & 1427.02 & 1422.18 (SOFMA) DATE4 SKK. & & RS. & Millions 4 & Crorks 10-2-86 8759.843 & 1509.06 23-2-86 8836.253 & 1522.22 07-3-86 8659.527 & 1491.78 & 1538.11 21-3-86 8096,230 & 1436.76 & 1438.05  \n\nFrom the above comparative chart it is evident that a keen competition was generated from 10th February, 1986 till the contract was finally signed on 24th March. 1986. It will be seen that Bofors had quoted on 10th February, 1986 a price of 1620 crores and the said price came down to 1427 crores on 21st March, 1986. thus there was a reduction of 193 crores. Similarly on the February, 1986 Sofma's offer was 1509 crores and on 21st March. 1986 it came down to 1436 crores, thus there was a reduction of 73 crores. Here it will be relevant to refer to para 6.16 of Jpc report wherein the then defense Secretary has given an explanation with respect to the increase of price of Bofors between 11-3-86 and 21-3-86 that, \"it was primarily because the package of equipment that we wanted to purchase underwent changes at several stages.\" Pursuant to the recommendations of the Negotiating Committee, the two Ministers of State for p:3 defense (RRM(s) and RRM(A)) and the then Minister of Finance gave their approval to the proposal on 13th March. 1986 and the then Prime Minister (as defense Minister) gave his approval on 14th March. 1986. Thereafter a letter of intent was issued in favor of Bofors on 14th March, 1986.(8) Approval of the then Prime Minister to the conclusion of the contract with Bofors was sought by the defense Secretary in a note initialed on 21st March, 1986 by the Joint Secretary (Ordnance), Ministry of defense. It was, inter alia, pointed out in this note that as a result of successive reductions by both the competing partics, the cost of their packages had come down substantially. It was also pointed out that Bofors' offer would become marginally expensive but it was cheaper in terms of the exchange rates of 11th and 21st March, 1986. It was further pointed out that the very substantial concessions obtained from the Bofors in the license Agreement had also to be kept in mind. Further, Bofors were providing commercial safeguards of a very sizeable magnitude by way of separate bank guarantees. The note also pointed out that the implications of the extra cost of manpower in the Sofma gun. Against a crew of 6 for the Bofors gun. the Sofma gun needed a crew of 7. In the result it was observed that our long association with Bofors in the defense production field (the L-70 A.A. Gun) should also mean a smoother process of setting up indigenous production.(9) After the letter of intent had been issued to Bofors as slated hercinabove. the note recorded by the defense Secretary on 22-3-86 indicates that as a result of discussion by the then Prime Minister of India with the then Prime Minister of Sweden, the availability of credit worth 3.1 Billion Sek was assured to cover the license production of the gun system and ammunition for a period of 90 months from the date of the agreement. After the letter of indent was issued to Bofors. Sofma offered slight modification i.e. 3.5 per cent across the board reduction and to "

The petitioner is the Acting Chairman and\n\nManaging Trustee of the Nehru College of Educational and\n\nCharitable Trust which has in its ownership and administration\n\n19 education institutions situated in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, one\n\nof them being Nehru College of Engineering and Research\n\nCentre situated at Pampadi in Thrissur District.      One Jishnu\n\nPranoy was a first year student in that college. On 06.01.2017\n\nhe appeared for the semester examination conducted from 2\n\npm and 5 pm. At about 4.30 pm he along with another student\n\nby name Jishnu Raj was caught for alleged malpractice.          At\n\nabout 6.30 pm Jishnu Pranoy committed suicide in his room in\n\nthe men's hostel attached to the college.         The local police\n\nregistered Crime No.19/2017 underSection 174Cr.P.C. The\n\nFirst Information Statement given by one of the students\n\nrevealed that there was harassment and mental torture by theB.A.No.1071 of 2017               2Vice Principal, the Invigilator and other officers of the college in\n\nconnection with the allegation of malpractice, which was the\n\nreason for Jishnu Pranoy's committing suicide.          Later, the\n\ngovernment constituted a Special Investigation Team to\n\ninvestigate into the incident. On 12.02.2017, the investigating\n\nofficer sent a report to the learned Magistrate concerned stating\n\nthat there is evidence to show commission of the offences\n\nunderSections 120-B,201,306,323,384,465,468and471IPC. The first semester examinations were originally scheduled\n\nto be held in the first week of December 2016.              It was\n\npostponed to January, 2017. The students left the hostel and\n\ntheir place of residence for their homes or elsewhere. Later,\n\nthey were informed that the examinations were advanced to\n\nDecember, 2016. Jishnu Pranoy protested against it and sent\n\ncomplaints to the University and other authorities and he urged\n\nother students to do so. The main ground was that there was\n\nviolation of the mandatory rule that minimum fourteen days\n\nnotice should be given for the examination. This was not liked\n\nby the college authorities and according to the prosecution theyB.A.No.1071 of 2017                 3targetted Jishnu Pranoy.         On 06.01.2017, the examination\n\nstarted at 2 pm and by about 4.30 pm the 4th accused, the\n\nInvigilator, asked Jishnu Pranoy and Jishnu Raj to produce their\n\nanswer sheets. The latter was sitting just in front of the former.\n\nThe Invigilator told them that Jishnu Raj allowed Jishnu Pranoy\n\nto copy his answers. Both of them denied it. They were taken\n\nto the principal's room, where they met the Vice Principal who\n\nis the 3rd accused in this case.        The Vice Principal and the\n\nInvigilator threatened Jishnu Raj as well as Jishnu Pranoy that\n\nunless they struck off their answers they would be barred for\n\nthree semesters. Jishnu Raj refused to do so. Jishnu Pranoy\n\nstruck off his answers. The Vice Principal and the Invigilator\n\ntook from him signed blank papers.               According to the\n\nprosecution those accused forged an apology letter in the\n\nsigned papers obtained from Jishnu Pranoy. This incident was\n\nthe immediate cause of Jishnu Pranoy's committing suicide.3. The allegation against the petitioner is seen in\n\nparagraphs 6 to 8 in the statement filed by the investigating\n\nofficer, Assistant Superintendent of Police. It is quoted below.B.A.No.1071 of 2017                     4\"6. The petitioner (A1) is the principal conspirator who\n\n       wants to enforce so called discipline in the college by\n\n       intimidating and mentally or physically harassing the\n\n       students. For the said purpose he conspired with the other\n\n       accused, from the very inception of the functioning of the\n\n       college and the said conspiracy is still in existence. In\n\n       accomplishment of the said conspiracy the accused used to\n\n       extort the students to sign blank papers with a view to\n\n       make it their false confessions so as to convert it into a\n\n       document for relinquishing the rights of the students who\n\n       complained against the illegal acts and deeds of the\n\n       college authorities. They hold the students to ransom, and\n\n       get these signatures by fear of injury as well as\n\n       withholding their school certificates and threatening them\n\n       of dire consequences in the exams and spoiling their\n\n       academic future.7. By doing these criminal acts, the petitioner A1,\n\n       along with other accused suppress the genuine grievances\n\n       and reasonable rights of the students. There is an\n\n       atmosphere of terror in the college campus amongst the\n\n       students due to this kind of venomous, vengeful and cruel\n\n       acts of the petitioner A1 and other accused. The broad\n\n       conspiracy is against those students who blow the whistle\n\n       against the misdoings of the management or raise issues\n\n       of student's welfare. Any leadership initiatives or attempt\n\n       for student union activities is thwarted by the petitioner A1\n\n       and other accused by sketching and targeting such\n\n       students, followed by methods such as reducing internalB.A.No.1071 of 2017                 5marks, attendance shortage, and fake allegations of\n\n       ragging, so as to punish them, which causes excruciating\n\n       pain to the targeted students due to loss of an academic\n\n       year as well as financial loss. The targeted student is\n\n       harassed mentally and physically, in the board room i.e.,\n\n       the room of accused A2. The room is called \"Idimuri\" by\n\n       the student fraternity. The Students are tortured here to\n\n       the extent of making him/her defenseless, helpless and\n\n       dispirited.\"All these incidents were done with active knowledge and\n\nconnivance of the petitioner. The accused are having definite\n\nknowledge that the above acts committed by them is sufficient\n\nto drive any person to do away with his life ........\" \"There are\n\ncircumstantial evidences to prove that he (Jishnu Pranoy) was\n\ntaken to the room of the accused A-2 and physically assaulted\n\nand mentally tortured with active knowledge of A-1.\"4. According to the prosecution the accused\n\nincluding the petitioner abetted the suicide of Jishnu Pranoy,\n\nwhich is the main allegation in this case. The learned counsel\n\nsubmits that the facts of the case do not attractSection 107IPC orSection 306IPC.5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitionerB.A.No.1071 of 2017                   6and the learned senior counsel Sri.C.P.Udayabhabu, who has\n\nbeen appointed by the government as Special Prosecutor in this\n\ncase.6. The initial and essential question that arises for\n\nthe consideration in this case is whether the prosecution has\n\nbeen able to collect any evidence to show that the petitioner\n\nwas involved in the incident which led to the suicide of Jishnu\n\nPranoy.7. The requirement ofSection 107IPC andSection 306IPC have been discussed in various decisions of\n\nHigh Courts as well as the Supreme Court. UnderSection 107IPC, a person can be said to have abetted a thing when he\n\ninstigates or intentionally aids the doing of that thing or enters\n\ninto a conspiracy for the doing of that thing. So far as this case\n\nis concerned, the only question is whether the petitioner\n\ninstigated commission of suicide by Jishnu Pranoy.8. The word 'instigation' is not defined inIndian\n\nPenal Code. Its dictionary meaning has been adopted by the\n\nSupreme Court in its various decision. To instigate means toB.A.No.1071 of 2017 "
