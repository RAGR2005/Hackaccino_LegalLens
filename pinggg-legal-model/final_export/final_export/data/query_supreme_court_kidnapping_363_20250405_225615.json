JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA\n\nMUKTA GUPTA, J. (ORAL)1.     By the present revision petition, the Petitioner seeks setting aside of\nthe order dated 1st March, 2016 passed by the learned Additional Sessions\nJudge framing charge against the Petitioner underSections 363/366AIPC,Section 109IPC read withSection 376DIPC andSection 17read withSection 6of Protection of Children againstSexual Offences Act, 2012(in\nshort 'POCSO Act'). The prosecution case springs out of FIR No. 78/2015\nregistered at PS Uttam Nagar underSection 363IPC lodged by the mother of\nthe prosecutrix.2.     After the prosecutrix was recovered, her statement was recorded underSection 164Cr.P.C. wherein she stated:-\"I like a boy named Shyam Kumar who has a fracture on his right\n     leg and cannot walk properly. Earlier also, I had gone to his house\n     four times but there was no physical relation between us.Crl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                   Page 1 of 8Yesterday, on 17th January, 2015 at 7:30 A.M., I bunked my school\n     and went to Shyam's house. When I told Shyam that I do not want\n     to stay in my house, he said that I can stay in his house. Shyam's\n     mother also admires me. Shyam called up Guddu, who is his friend,\n     and told him that they need a place to stay at night. Till 7:30 P.M.,\n     we stayed at Shyam's house. After 7:30 P.M., we took an auto from\n     Shyam's house and reached Nand Nagari. Thereafter, Shyam rang\n     up his friend Guddu and called him there. But Guddu asked them to\n     reach Bank Colony stand. Guddu came to Bank Colony stand and\n     took us to the house of Sushil who was his friend. There Guddu told\n     us to go upstairs. The entire night Shyam and I kept awake in the\n     room upstairs as Sushil and Guddu were also present in that room\n     and we did not trust them. In morning at 5:00 A.M., Guddu took the\n     phone of Shyam and was not returning him in fun which annoyed\n     Shyam but still the phone was not returned. Then Guddu and\n     Shyam went to take the auto. Shyam repeatedly requested to take\n     me along but Guddu did not agree and took Shyam along with him\n     on bike. After 10 minutes, Guddu returned and told that after\n     pushing Shyam he has returned. Then Sushil and Guddu, one by\n     one, did wrong act with me. Wrong act means rape. Though I\n     cried still they did not leave me. Then Guddu took me to Bank\n     Colony stand on bike where Shyam Ji was sitting and waiting for\n     me. There we took auto and after Guddu left and when Shyam\n     inquired I told everything to Shyam. I also told him that I was\n     bleeding and was having a lot of pain. Then we went to the house\n     of Shyam. There my relatives were present and my mother started\n     beating Shyam and blaming him even though he did not do\n     anything with me. Wrong act with me was done by Sushil and\n     Guddu. Guddu previously also raped a minor girl.\"3.     The ingredients of the offence of kidnapping punishable underSection\n363IPC were discussed by Supreme Court in the decision reported asAIR\n1965 SC 942 S. Varadarajan v. State of Madrasand the relevant extract of\nthe report are:\"9. It must, however, be borne in mind that there is a distinction\n     between \"taking\" and allowing a minor to accompany a person.Crl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                    Page 2 of 8The two expressions are not synonymous though we would like to\n     guard ourselves from laying down that in no conceivable\n     circumstances can the two be regarded as meaning the same\n     thing for the purposes ofSection 361of the Indian Penal Code.\n     We would limit ourselves to a case like the present where the\n     minor alleged to have been taken by the accused person left her\n     father's protection knowing and having capacity to know the full\n     import of what she was doing voluntarily joins the accused\n     person. In such a case we do not think that the accused can be\n     said to have taken her away from the keeping of her lawful\n     guardian. Something more has to be shown in a case of this kind\n     and that is some kind of inducement held out by the accused\n     person or an active participation by him in the formation of the\n     intention of the minor to leave the house of the guardian.\"4.     The prosecutrix in her statement recorded underSection 164Cr.P.C.\nstated that she voluntarily went to the petitioner's house and thereafter they\nwent to the house of a friend as they required a room for the night. Thus, the\ningredients of offence punishable underSection 363IPC are not made out.\nHence there is no prima facie case made out against the petitioner for\nframing a charge for offence punishable underSection 363IPC.5.Section 366AIPC reads as under:-\"366A. procuration of minor girl.--Whoever, by any means\n     whatsoever, induces any minor girl under the age of eighteen\n     years to go from any place or to do any act with intent that such\n     girl may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or\n     seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall be\n     punishable with imprisonment which may extend to ten years, and\n     shall also be liable to fine.\"6.     From the statement of the prosecutrix, it is evident that when the\npetitioner took her to the house of the friend to spend the night, it was neither\nwith the intent nor knowledge that she will be forced or seduced to illicitCrl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                      Page 3 of 8intercourse. Thus, on the statement of the prosecutrix itself, no prima facie\ncase for framing of charge for offence punishable underSection 366AIPC\nalso is made out against the petitioner.7.     Supreme Court in the decision reported as (2007) 15 SCC 670\nKulwant Singh aliasKulbansh Singh Vs. State of Bihardealing withSection\n109IPC held that mere failure to prevent the commission of offence is not\nby itself an abetment of that offence. It was held-\"11.Section 109IPC reads as follows:\"109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is\n          committed in consequence and where no express provision is\n          made for its punishment.--Whoever abets any offence shall, if\n          the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment,\n          and no express provision is made by this Code for the\n          punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment\n          provided for the offence.Explanation.--An act or offence is said to be committed in\n          consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence\n          of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with\n          the aid which constitutes the abetment.Illustrations(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for\n          showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official\n          functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence\n          defined in Section 161.(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence\n          of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting\n          that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.Crl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                     Page 4 of 8(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A in pursuance of the\n          conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order\n          that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the\n          conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and\n          thereby causes Z's death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty\n          of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the\n          punishment for murder.\"12. Where a person aids and abets the perpetrator of a\n          crime at the very time the crime is committed, he is a principal\n          of the second degree and Section 109 applies. But mere failure\n          to prevent the commission of an offence is not by itself an\n          abetment of that offence. Considering the definition in Section\n          109 strictly, the instigation must have reference to the thing\n          that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been\n          done by the person who is instigated. It is only if this condition\n          is fulfilled that a person can be guilty of abetment by\n          instigation. Section 109 is attracted even if the abettor is not\n          present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he\n          had instigated the commission of the offence or has engaged\n          with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an\n          offence and pursuant to the conspiracy some act or illegal\n          omission takes place or has intentionally induced the\n          commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission. In the\n          absence of direct involvement, conviction for abetment is not\n          sustainable. (SeeJoseph Kurian v. State of Kerala[(1994) 6\n          S"

Case No. 12049/2019\n                              JUDGMENTBrief facts1. Vide this judgment, I shall dispose of a matter which is\n   pending in the Court since the year 2010, i.e., for last\n   about fifteen years.2. The prosecution version in brief is that on 28.03.2010 at\n   about 5:00 PM, accused Mahabir and Nar Singh, in\n   furtherance of their common intention kidnapped a minor\n   boy namely Vijay, aged about 14 years, and took him out\n   of the lawful guardianship of his uncle namely Vishnu Dutt\n   in a car at Gali near House number D-2/63, Om Vihar,\n   Phase-V, Uttam Nagar, Delhi and while doing so, he\n   caused simple hurt on the person of victim Vijay by\n   beating him in the car. On the basis of the complaint made\n   by the complainant, an FIR bearing no. 95/2010 was\n   registeredu/s 363IPC at PS Uttam Nagar. The\n   investigation of the case was conducted by the\n   Investigating Officer SI Ranvir Singh and thereafter by IO\n   SI Vijender Singh.Proceedings before the Court3. On completion of investigation, a chargesheetu/s\n   363/365/323/34of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter\n   referred to as 'IPC') was filed against the accused persons\n   Mahabir and Nar Singh @ Narshi. After taking cognizance\n   of the offences, the accused persons were summoned to\n   face trial.State v/s Mahabir etc.                 Page 2 of 24Cr. Case No. 12049/20194. On their appearance, a copy of chargesheet along with\n  documents were supplied to the accused in terms ofSection 207of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter\n  referred to as 'CrPC'). On finding prima facie case against\n  the accused persons, a charge undersection 363/323/34IPC was framed against them, to which they had pleaded\n  not guilty and claimed trial.5. During the course of trial, proceedings against accused\n  Mahabir Singh were abated vide order dated 18.04.2023.6. During the trial, prosecution has examined the following\n   witnesses:i.     PW-1 Vishu Dutt has deposed that on 28.03.2010, he\n            was residing at WZ-41A, Bal Udyan Road, Uttam\n            Nagar Extension, Delhi and his brother Mukesh was\n            residing at D-2/63, Gali No. 10, Om Vihar, Phase-V,\n            Uttam Nagar. On that day, his brother had gone to\n            Rohtak. He (the witness) was informed that his\n            nephew namely Vijay @ Sonu (son of Mukesh\n            Kumar), aged about 14-15 years, who was playing\n            in the gali near his house, had gone missing. He\n            tried to search for his nephew, but he was not found.He lodged a missing complaint at PS Uttam Nagar.\n            His statement (Ex. PW-1/A) was recorded. On the\n            next day, his nephew was found. His nephew\n            informed him that he was kidnapped by Mahavir\n            and Nar Singh @ Naresh. This witness was cross-\n            examined by Ld. Defence counsel. In his cross-State v/s Mahabir etc.                    Page 3 of 24Cr. Case No. 12049/2019examination, the witness stated that he had not seen\n         that the accused persons Mahabir (now deceased)\n         and Nar Singh had kidnapped his nephew.

The accused forcibly\n         took him in the car and they started driving him to\n         different parts of Delhi. On the way, both the\n         accused persons had given beatings to him and they\n         wanted to know about the jewellery and cash lying\n         in his house. At about 2:30 AM, they dropped him\n         near Sai Baba Mandir, Najafgarh, Delhi and went\n         away. He had sustained injuries.
