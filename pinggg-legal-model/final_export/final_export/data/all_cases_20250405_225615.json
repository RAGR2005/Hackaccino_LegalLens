As all the captioned applications underSection 389of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for suspension of the\nsubstantive order of sentence of life imprisonment arise from a\nself-same judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed\nby the trial court, those were heard analogously and are being\ndisposed of by this common order.2.

We take notice of the fact that two cross-cases were tried\ntogether and both the sessions cases came to be disposed of by\na common judgment and order. The six applicants herein\nseeking suspension of the substantive order of sentence are\noriginal accused nos.2, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 respectively of the\nSessions Case No.152 of 2011. All the six applicants herein have\nbeen convicted for the offence punishable underSection 302IPC\nsimpliciter by determining their individual liability and have\nbeen sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. The trial court\ndisbelieved the case put up by the prosecution of unlawful\nassembly and common object. Accordingly, all the accused\npersons of both the cases came to be acquitted of the offences\npunishable underSections 147,148,149,427, 504, 506(2) andPage 2 of 86R/CR.A/1314/2018                               JUDGEMENT\n\n\n\n120B of theIndian Penal Code.

The State has\nthought fit to file acquittal appeal so far as the acquittal of the\naccused persons of the offences punishable underSections 147,148,149,427,504,506(2)and120Bof the Indian Penal Code is\nconcerned.4.    It is the case of the prosecution that on the date of the\nincident, i.e. on 26th April 2011 at about 6:15 in the evening, 24\naccused persons armed with deadly weapons like sword, stick,\nsickle,   etc.    formed        an   unlawful        assembly   and     laid   an\nindiscriminate assault on the prosecution witnesses. In the said\nassault, one Babukhan Yusufkhan Pathan sustained severe\nhead injuries and succumbed.5.    To give a fair idea as regards the case put up by the\nprosecution, we may reproduce some portion of the evidence of\none of the eye-witnesses to the incident. The prosecution\nexamined PW3 Rahenakhatun Aslamkhan Pathan (Exh.135).\nShe is one of the injured eye-witnesses.

Thereafter, my brother had made an application\nto the Taluka Development Officer, Mangrol, to disqualify\nAshif Maiyuddin as he was having three children. As per\nthe Government resolution, Ashif Maiyuddin was liable to\nbe disqualified, therefore, he was dismissed from the post\nof Deputy Sarpanch.

Try out ourPremium Member Services--Sign up todayand get free trial for one month.Delhi High CourtBhagwati Foundation And Ors. vs Commissioner Of Mcd And Ors. on 31 October, 2006Author:Gita MittalBench:Gita MittalJUDGMENT\n \n\nGita Mittal, J.1. By this judgment, I propose to dispose of a bunch of writ petitions all laying a challenge to a decision taken by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (referred to as MCD hereafter) to transfer all Community Toilet Complexes (hereinafter referred to as CTCs) constructed by it and under its jurisdiction for operation and maintenance to the Sulabh International Social Service Organisations (referred to as Sulabh for brevity) and cancellation of the agreements with the petitioners and other Non-Governmental Agencies (referred to as NGOs) to whom they were handed over for operation and maintenance. The challenge has been laid primarily on grounds of violation ofArticle 14of the Constitution of India so far as the decision to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh is concerned while the cancellation of the allotments of the NGOs is challenged on grounds of arbitrariness, malafide, illegality and violation of principles of natural justice.2. Sanitation is undoubtedly a basic service which is a right which must be ensured to every citizen, be it an adult or a child. Sanitation is a felt need while hygiene is important to health. This is a service which needs to be imperatively maintained at the community level. While those who are poor cannot pay for the provision and maintenance of the basic service provided to them, a completely free service runs the risk of the service not being valued at all and even be misused. Community participation in planning, construction and maintenance of such like services ensures that the community values it and will use it. Contribution to creation of such facilities may be by dispensation of finance, real estate, labour or service. When people do not have the time to contribute labour or otherwise to the construction, operation and maintenance, they are required to pay a charge for the service. A small contribution, no matter how small, is often a confirmation of the value of a service to the people and their willingness to maintain it. In developing nations, the problem is more aggravated, inasmuch as it is necessary even to educate and inculcate the habit of using a toilet in people who have never seen the facility. This lack of information and knowledge however exacerbates the problems which are faced by metropolitan cities to which people from remote corners of the country migrate without any idea of sanitation facilities or basic hygiene.In certain countries, much has been done to generate enlightenment about private toilets even in remote villages. My attention has been drawn to a good practice example which is to be found from Bangladesh where large NGOs provide the material for constructing a latrine but the beneficiary family, however poor, finds the time to construct the soak pit and the walls (often of thatch material and bamboo). BRAC, an NGO in Bangladesh has created an entire movement for sanitising entire villages based on this type of participation by the users of the service themselves. Some other agencies even give material on credit, of about 600 taka and recover it slowly over several years. This is not a significant burden on the family, but works as a mechanism through which people actually demand and value basic services.3. The pressure on this city has been always in tremendous. Large numbers from all over the country descend in droves upon Delhi in search of employment or other opportunities and never leave. It is to address the basic needs of such persons who have no permanent abodes that the civic authorities including the Municipal Corporation of Delhi have had to concentrate, conceptualise and develop common toilet complexes which provides both toilet and bathroom facilities for the community.4. Over the years, several modules of the operation and maintenance of these common toilet complexes (hereinafter referred to as 'CTCs') have been tested by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi which is the primary body concerned with health, sanitation, sewerage and other areas relating to provision of civic amenities and facilities to the citizens of Delhi. As the present matter impugns the actions of this body, consideration is confined to this civic authority, which for brevity is referred to as the `MCD'.Perspective5. In order to appreciate the issues raised in the present writ petition, it becomes necessary to see the historical perspective of the experience of the corporation in this behalf. These can be divided into six stages and modules which briefly put, would be as hereunder:(a) Between 1988 to 1994, CTCs numbering 124 were got constructed by MCD from Sulabh at the cost of the MCD. This non-governmental organisation was paid the estimated cost of the construction on market rate; cost of boring the tubewell; and 12.5% of the implementation charges. They were given to Sulabh on pay and use basis for a period of 30 years. Electricity, water charges and cleaning of the septic tank of the CTC was the responsibility of the MCD. The salient features of the operation and maintenance terms of these CTCs were that the NGO was to run them on the 'pay and use basis' for a period of thirty years. These complexes were known as the 'Sulabh Shauchalya's'.Sulabh was thus responsible for 124 CTCs on these terms.(b). Between 1994-2000, the Slum & JJ Department has delegated 207 CTCs to other NGOs on the same terms. These 207 CTCs were known as the 'Jan Suvidha Complexes'.It is noteworthy that no complaint in respect of either the operation or the maintenance or the management by either Sulabh of these 124 Sulabh Sauchalayas or the other NGOs who are running operating maintaining and managing the 207 Jan Suvidha Complexes has been brought to the notice of the MCD or has been placed before this Court.(ii) Between 1975 and 1980 construction of 66 CTCs was carried out by the MCD as per usual contract procedures through contractors and handed over for further maintenance to the Conservation & Sanitation Engineering Department for further maintenance with effect from 1992 onwards. These toilets have been called as the 'Jan Suvidha Toilet Complexes'. In the year 1990, these 66 CTCs were handed over to Sulabh for a contract of one year which was to be extendable up to 5 years. As per the agreement between the MCD and M/s Sulabh, the MCD was required to make annual payment of Rs. 1000/- per WC seat per bathroom plus per bath room on account of annual repairs to Sulabh in respect of these toilets. The MCD was also responsible for payment of electricity and water consumption as well as cleaning of the septic tanks. They were to be operated by Sulabh on pay and use basis.(iii). The third category consists of the 84 CTCs constructed by the Slum & JJ Department, then of the DDA, during the period 1984 to 1990 in Jhuggi Jhompri Clusters and were transferred in 1992 from the DDA to the Conservation & Sanitation Engineering Department of the MCD for further maintenance. Eighty four such CTCs were handed over to Sulabh for a period of 30 years on the same terms as the earlier 66 CTCs. MCD also undertook to pay Rs. 1000/- per WC seat plus per bathroom annually on account of annual repairs to the NGO. In addition, the MCD was responsible for bearing electricity and water consumption charges and cleaning of the septic tank was also the responsibility of the MCD.The MCD has not placed the expenditure that it has incurred on the payments which were effected to Sulabh on these agreements or the electricity, water and cleaning of the septic tank. However the petitioners have placed information before this Court to the effect that the MCD was allegedly paying an amount of Rs. 97,66,000/- each year to Sulabh towards the Rs. 1000/- per seat per WC per bathroom amount. Even these agreements were for a period of thirty years in favor of Sulabh and the user was on 'pay and use' basis.(iv). The fourth category of CTCs was constructed by the Slum & JJ Department through contractors during the period 1994 onwards. 166 CTCs were so constructed. MCD had decided to hand over their operation and maintenance to NGOs on a license fee basis. Consequently allocation was made by tenders for a period of one to three years on license fee basis to NGOs, CBOs and local residents etc. As per the agreement entered into by the MCD and the allottees for the operation and maintenance of these CTCs, they were to be operated on 'pay and use basis'. Additionally the NGO/allottee was responsible for all repairs including the day to day maintenance upkeep; the annual repairs as well as maintenance etc. The NGO was also responsible for payment of the electricity and water consumption charges as well as the maintenance and cleaning of the septic tank.Thus the MCD had clearly abdicated all responsibilities of running and maintenance of these CTCs to the NGOs.The petitioners have pointed out that so far as these 166 CTCs are concerned, 30 NGOs were successful in securing contracts with the MCD for the operation and maintenance of these CTCs. These 30 NGOs included 7 organisations which, according to the petitioners, are sister concerns of Sulabh. The petitioners have contended that the MCD has collected substantial amount as license fee from these NGOs. Additionally, there is no complaint whatsoever in respect of the running and operation and maintenance of these CTCs ever since they were allotted and handed over to the NGOs.The MCD however is silent in all its assertions with regard to the amount that it had earned from these CTCs and no information in this behalf has been placed even before this Court.(v). The fifth category of the CTCs are the 357 complexe"

JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA\n\nMUKTA GUPTA, J. (ORAL)1.     By the present revision petition, the Petitioner seeks setting aside of\nthe order dated 1st March, 2016 passed by the learned Additional Sessions\nJudge framing charge against the Petitioner underSections 363/366AIPC,Section 109IPC read withSection 376DIPC andSection 17read withSection 6of Protection of Children againstSexual Offences Act, 2012(in\nshort 'POCSO Act'). The prosecution case springs out of FIR No. 78/2015\nregistered at PS Uttam Nagar underSection 363IPC lodged by the mother of\nthe prosecutrix.2.     After the prosecutrix was recovered, her statement was recorded underSection 164Cr.P.C. wherein she stated:-\"I like a boy named Shyam Kumar who has a fracture on his right\n     leg and cannot walk properly. Earlier also, I had gone to his house\n     four times but there was no physical relation between us.Crl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                   Page 1 of 8Yesterday, on 17th January, 2015 at 7:30 A.M., I bunked my school\n     and went to Shyam's house. When I told Shyam that I do not want\n     to stay in my house, he said that I can stay in his house. Shyam's\n     mother also admires me. Shyam called up Guddu, who is his friend,\n     and told him that they need a place to stay at night. Till 7:30 P.M.,\n     we stayed at Shyam's house. After 7:30 P.M., we took an auto from\n     Shyam's house and reached Nand Nagari. Thereafter, Shyam rang\n     up his friend Guddu and called him there. But Guddu asked them to\n     reach Bank Colony stand. Guddu came to Bank Colony stand and\n     took us to the house of Sushil who was his friend. There Guddu told\n     us to go upstairs. The entire night Shyam and I kept awake in the\n     room upstairs as Sushil and Guddu were also present in that room\n     and we did not trust them. In morning at 5:00 A.M., Guddu took the\n     phone of Shyam and was not returning him in fun which annoyed\n     Shyam but still the phone was not returned. Then Guddu and\n     Shyam went to take the auto. Shyam repeatedly requested to take\n     me along but Guddu did not agree and took Shyam along with him\n     on bike. After 10 minutes, Guddu returned and told that after\n     pushing Shyam he has returned. Then Sushil and Guddu, one by\n     one, did wrong act with me. Wrong act means rape. Though I\n     cried still they did not leave me. Then Guddu took me to Bank\n     Colony stand on bike where Shyam Ji was sitting and waiting for\n     me. There we took auto and after Guddu left and when Shyam\n     inquired I told everything to Shyam. I also told him that I was\n     bleeding and was having a lot of pain. Then we went to the house\n     of Shyam. There my relatives were present and my mother started\n     beating Shyam and blaming him even though he did not do\n     anything with me. Wrong act with me was done by Sushil and\n     Guddu. Guddu previously also raped a minor girl.\"3.     The ingredients of the offence of kidnapping punishable underSection\n363IPC were discussed by Supreme Court in the decision reported asAIR\n1965 SC 942 S. Varadarajan v. State of Madrasand the relevant extract of\nthe report are:\"9. It must, however, be borne in mind that there is a distinction\n     between \"taking\" and allowing a minor to accompany a person.Crl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                    Page 2 of 8The two expressions are not synonymous though we would like to\n     guard ourselves from laying down that in no conceivable\n     circumstances can the two be regarded as meaning the same\n     thing for the purposes ofSection 361of the Indian Penal Code.\n     We would limit ourselves to a case like the present where the\n     minor alleged to have been taken by the accused person left her\n     father's protection knowing and having capacity to know the full\n     import of what she was doing voluntarily joins the accused\n     person. In such a case we do not think that the accused can be\n     said to have taken her away from the keeping of her lawful\n     guardian. Something more has to be shown in a case of this kind\n     and that is some kind of inducement held out by the accused\n     person or an active participation by him in the formation of the\n     intention of the minor to leave the house of the guardian.\"4.     The prosecutrix in her statement recorded underSection 164Cr.P.C.\nstated that she voluntarily went to the petitioner's house and thereafter they\nwent to the house of a friend as they required a room for the night. Thus, the\ningredients of offence punishable underSection 363IPC are not made out.\nHence there is no prima facie case made out against the petitioner for\nframing a charge for offence punishable underSection 363IPC.5.Section 366AIPC reads as under:-\"366A. procuration of minor girl.--Whoever, by any means\n     whatsoever, induces any minor girl under the age of eighteen\n     years to go from any place or to do any act with intent that such\n     girl may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or\n     seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall be\n     punishable with imprisonment which may extend to ten years, and\n     shall also be liable to fine.\"6.     From the statement of the prosecutrix, it is evident that when the\npetitioner took her to the house of the friend to spend the night, it was neither\nwith the intent nor knowledge that she will be forced or seduced to illicitCrl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                      Page 3 of 8intercourse. Thus, on the statement of the prosecutrix itself, no prima facie\ncase for framing of charge for offence punishable underSection 366AIPC\nalso is made out against the petitioner.7.     Supreme Court in the decision reported as (2007) 15 SCC 670\nKulwant Singh aliasKulbansh Singh Vs. State of Bihardealing withSection\n109IPC held that mere failure to prevent the commission of offence is not\nby itself an abetment of that offence. It was held-\"11.Section 109IPC reads as follows:\"109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is\n          committed in consequence and where no express provision is\n          made for its punishment.--Whoever abets any offence shall, if\n          the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment,\n          and no express provision is made by this Code for the\n          punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment\n          provided for the offence.Explanation.--An act or offence is said to be committed in\n          consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence\n          of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with\n          the aid which constitutes the abetment.Illustrations(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for\n          showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official\n          functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence\n          defined in Section 161.(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence\n          of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting\n          that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.Crl.Rev.P.424/2016                                                     Page 4 of 8(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A in pursuance of the\n          conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order\n          that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the\n          conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and\n          thereby causes Z's death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty\n          of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the\n          punishment for murder.\"12. Where a person aids and abets the perpetrator of a\n          crime at the very time the crime is committed, he is a principal\n          of the second degree and Section 109 applies. But mere failure\n          to prevent the commission of an offence is not by itself an\n          abetment of that offence. Considering the definition in Section\n          109 strictly, the instigation must have reference to the thing\n          that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been\n          done by the person who is instigated. It is only if this condition\n          is fulfilled that a person can be guilty of abetment by\n          instigation. Section 109 is attracted even if the abettor is not\n          present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he\n          had instigated the commission of the offence or has engaged\n          with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an\n          offence and pursuant to the conspiracy some act or illegal\n          omission takes place or has intentionally induced the\n          commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission. In the\n          absence of direct involvement, conviction for abetment is not\n          sustainable. (SeeJoseph Kurian v. State of Kerala[(1994) 6\n          S"

He  bolted\nthe door from inside, completely stripped off himself,\tmade\nPW.  13\t completely  naked and asked  her  to  do  fellatio.\nThereafter he slightly inserted his penis into her vulva and\nlay  over her. After sometime he freed the child. While\t she\nwas leaving the drawing hall, the respondent threatened\t her\nnot  to\t disclose  his\taffairs\t to  anyone.  She,  however,\nnarrated the incident to respondent's niece.\n     In the evening PW. 13 told her mother (PW. 6) that\t the\nrespondent  had asked her to suck his private part. She did\nnot  narrate  the whole incident out of fear. The  next\t day\nwhen  PW.  13  and respondent's niece were  talking  of\t the\nincident,  their friend PW. 12 came there. PW.\t13  narrated\nthe  incident  to her and other girl friends. On  the  third\nday,  PW.  13  told the entire incident to  her\t mother\t who\nconveyed it to her neighbours PWs. 9 and 10 on telephone. At\nabout  9 p.m. when the appellant (PW.5), the father  of\t the\nvictim girl, returned home and learnt about the\t occurrence,\nhe  accompanied\t by  PWs. 7,9 and 10  went  to\trespondent's\nhouse,\tbut he was not there and they informed\tthe  brother\nand sister-in-law of the respondent of the purpose of  their\nvisit.\tThey  all  waited  there  till\tmidnight  when\t the\nrespondent  came. The respondent, assessing  the  situation,\nvoluntarily  confessed his crime. He admitted that he  raped\nPW.  13\t and  also  committed  the  same  crime\t on  earlier\noccasions with his niece and other minor girls, but being  a\ndoctor\the  had\t been careful enough not  to  rupture  their\nhymen.\tThe  brother of the respondent begged of PW.  5\t and\nothers\tnot to do anything till the arrival of his  parents.\nNext  morning  when respondent's parents reached,  he  again\nadmitted his abominable crime of sexual assault on PW. 13.\n     It\t took  2-3  days  more to PW. 5\t to  get  a  written\ncomplaint  (Ext. P.7) lodged with the police through PW.  8.\nThe  police  investigation culminated in the  trial  of\t the\nrespondent for an offence of rape committed on PW. 13.\n     The  trial court held that the prosecution against\t the\nrespondent  was launched due to some enmity between the\t two\nfamilies and that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t       923\nprosecution  did  not  adduce any  acceptable  evidence\t for\nholding\t the respondent guilty of offence unders. 376IPC.\nIt accordingly acquitted the respondent.\n     The  State\t filed an appeal an  against  the  acquittal\nbefore the High Court. The complainant-appellant also  filed\na criminal revision challenging the legality of the order of\nacquittal.  On\tthe  basis of an  artical  relating  to\t the\nincident  published  in a foreign magazine, a  petition\t was\naddressed  to the Chief Justice of India with a copy to\t the\nChief Justice  of the High Court concerned and on its  basis\nanother criminal revision petition was registered. The\tHigh\nCourt disposed of all the three cases by a common  judgment.\nIt accepted the oral testimony of prosecution witnesses\t and\nthe  extra-judicial confession made by the  respondent.\t It,\nhowever,  held the respondent guilty of an offence under  s.\n354IPCand sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 3,000  only.\nThe complainant-appellant filed the appeal by special  leave\nto this Court.\tThe State did not file any appeal.\n     It\t was contended on behalf of the appellant  that\t the\nHigh Court erred in holding the respondent guilty of a minor\noffence unders. 354IPC when all the necessary\t ingredients\nto  constitute\tan offence punishable unders. 376IPC\t had\nbeen  satisfactorily established; and the sentence  of\tfine\nalone  imposed was grossly inadequate and  not\tcommensurate\nwith the gravity of the offence committed by the respondent.\n     Allowing  the appeal and setting aside the judgment  of\nthe High Court, this Court,\n     HELD   :\t1.  The\t  prosecution\thas   satisfactorily\nestablished  its case that the respondent committed rape  on\nPW. 13 by proving all the necessary ingredients required  to\nmake  out  an offence of rape punishable underSection\t 376IPC. [p. 947 B]\n     2. When the evidence of PW. 13-that the respondent\t put\nhis  male  organ  inside her vagina  and  clutched  her\t and\nthereafter  she suffered pain-is taken with the evidence  of\nmedical officer who found an abrasion on the medical side of\nlabia  majora and redness present around the  labia   minora\nwith  white  discharge even after 5 days, it can  be  safely\nconcluded  that\t there was partial  penetration\t within\t the\nlabia  majora  or the vulva or pudenda which  in  the  legal\nsense is sufficient to constitute the offence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t       924\nrape.  Moreover,  the  respondent  himself  confessed  twice\nadmitting the commission of rape without rupturing the hymen\nwhich  confession is not disbelieved by the High Court.\t [p.\n946 C; E-F]\n     3.1.  The evidence of PW. 13 is amply corroborated\t not\nonly by the medical evidence and the evidence of PW. 12\t but\nalso  by the  plenary confession of the respondent  himself.\n[p. 947 A]\n     3.2  Even\tin  cases  wherein there  is  lack  of\toral\ncorroboration to that of a prosecutrix, a conviction can  be\nsafely\trecorded, provided the evidence of the\tvictim\tdoes\nnot suffer from any basic infirmity, and the  `probabilities\nfactor' does not render it unworthy of credence, and that as\na  general  rule,  corroboration cannot\t be  insisted  upon,\nexcept\tfrom the medical evidence, where, having  regard  to\nthe  circumstances  of\tthe case, medical  evidence  can  be\nexpected to be forthcoming.

WADHWA, J.leave granted\n     Rajendra Jawanmal Gandhi (the accused) was convicted by\nthe Sessions  Judge, Satara  for offences  underSection 376Indian Penal  Code  (IPC)  andSection\t 57of\t the  Bombay\nChildren Act,  1948 for\t having committed  rape on a girl of\neight  years  of  age  and  sentenced  to  undergo  rigorous\nimprisonment for  7 years  and to pay fine of Rs.5,000/- and\nin  default   of  payment   of\tfine   to  undergo  rigorous\nimprisonment for six months and for offence underSection 57of the\tBombay Children\t Act, he  was sentenced\t to  undergo\nrigorous imprisonment  for one year and fine of Rs.500/- and\nin default  thereof rigorous  imprisonment for one moth. The\nsubstantive sentences  were  ordered  to  urn  concurrently.\nMaruti car  in which  the offence  of rape was committed was\nordered to  be forfeited  and confiscated  to the State. The\naccused appealed  to  the  Bombay  High\t Court\tagainst\t his\nconviction and\tsentence. A Division Bench of the High Court\nby judgment  dated October  4, 1994 upheld the conviction of\nthe accused  underSection 57of the Bombay Children Act and\nupset the  conviction underSection  376IPC\tand  instead\nconvicted him  for an  offence underSection  354IPC\t and\nsentenced him  to suffer  rigorous imprisonment which he had\nalready undergone (which was 33 days in all) and to pay fine\nof Rs.40,000/-.\t In default  of payment of fine, the accused\nwas sentenced  to undergo  rigorous imprisonment  for  three\nmonths. It  was ordered\t that our of the fine so realised, a\nsum of\tRs.25,000/- shall  be paid  to the complaint who was\nfather of  the girl.  For an offence underSection 57of the\nBombay Children\t Act, sentence\twas reduced  to imprisonment\nalready undergone  and the  accused not\t required to undergo\nany separate  imprisonment for\tthis offence. The Maruti Car\nwas ordered  to be  returned to the accused and the order of\nforfeiture and confiscation was set aside.The matter\t did not  end at  that. Nagrik Kirti Samiti,\nKolhapur which\thad  been  formed  was\tagitated  about\t the\nacquittal of  the accused  for an  offence underSection 376IPC. The Convener of the Samiti Mr. P.D. Hankare represented\nto the\tState Government  to file  an appeal  to this  Court\nagainst the  acquittal of the accused underSection 376IPC.\nIn the\tmeantime, the  accused had  deposited  the  fine  of\nRs.40,000/- as\tordered by  the High  Court and\t our of this\namount a sum of Rs.25,000/- has been withdrawn by the father\nof the\tgirl. Perhaps  this was\t the consideration  for\t the\nState Government  not to  file any  appeal  in\tthe  Supreme\nCourt.\tSince\tthere  was   no\t response   from  the  State\nGovernment, Mr.\t P.D. Hankare, Convener of the Nagarik Kirti\nSamiti, Kolhapur  approached  this  Court.  He\twas  granted\npermission  to\tfile  special  leave  petition\tagainst\t the\nconviction and sentence on the accused by the High Court and\nas afore  mentioned, after  notice of this appeal was served\nupon the  State of  Maharashtra and  the accused, both filed\nseparate  appeals   in\tthis   Court,  while  the  State  of\nMaharashtra filed appeal against the conviction and sentence\nof the\taccused by the High Court praying for his conviction\nunderSection 376IPC and for enhancement of his sentence of\nminimum of  10 years,  the accused  filed appeal against his\nvery conviction and sentence underSection 354IPC and 57 of\ntheBombay Children  Act.Since the\tState itself has filed an appeal praying for\nconviction of  the accused underSection 376IPC and for his\npunishment under  Section 376(f)  as the girl child was less\nthan 12\t years\tof  age,  leave\t granted  to  P.D.  Hankare,\nConvener,  Nagrik   Kirti   Samiti,   Kolhapur\t Loses\t its\nsignificance and we direct that the leave be revoked.It may  be noticed\t at the\t outset that the offence was\ncommitted at  Kolhapur and the accused was to be tried there\nin the\tcourt of  Session. But because of public outcry, the\nplea of\t the accused  that he  may not\tget  fair  trial  at\nKolhapur was  accepted and  the case  was transferred to the\nfile of Sessions Judge, Satara.Before we\tconsider the  rival contentions,  we may set\nout the\t relevant provisions  of law under which the accused\nwas tried:Section 375  and Section  376 in  relevant part  is  as\nunder:\"375 Rape.\t A man is said to commit\n     \"rape\"  who,  except  in  the  case\n     hereinafter  excepted,  has  sexual\n     intercourse  with\t a  woman  under\n     circumstances falling  under any of\n     the six of following descriptions:-\n     First.- Against her will.\n     Secondly.- Without her consent.\n     Thirdly.- With  her  consent,  when\n     her consent  has been  obtained  by\n     putting her  or any  person in whom\n     she is  interested in fear of death\n     or of hurt.Fourthly.- With  her consent,  when\n     the man  knows that  he is\t not her\n     husband, and  that her  consent  is\n     given because  she believes that he\n     is another\t man to\t whom she  is or\n     believes  herself\tto  be\tlawfully\n     married\n     Fifthly.- With  her consent,  when,\n     at the time of giving such consent,\n     by reason of unsoundness of mind or\n     intoxication or  the administration\n     by\t him   personally   or\t through\n     another  of   any\t stupefying   or\n     unwholesome   substance,\tshe   is\n     unable to understand the nature and\n     consequences of  that to which shed\n     gives consent.Sixthly.-\tWith   or  without   her\n     consent, when  she is under sixteen\n     years of age.Explanation.-    Penetration     is\n     sufficient to constitute the sexual\n     inercourse necessary to the offence\n     of rape.Exception.- Sexual intercourse by a\n     man with his own wife, the wife not\n     being under  fifteen years\t of age,\n     is not rape.376.
