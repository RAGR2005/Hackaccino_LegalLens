The driver\nwas acquitted  on the  ground that the tragedy was an act of\nGod. The Accidents Tribunal held that despite the screams of\nthe passenger  about the  dangerous over-hanging  wire ahead\nthe rash  driver sped towards the spot which resulted in the\naccident.  The\tHigh  Court  affirmed  the  finding  of\t the\nTribunal that  the accident  had taken place due to rashness\nand negligence of the driver and consequently the petitioner\nwas vicariously liable to pay compensation to the claimant.\n     Dismissing the petition,\n^\n     HELD: 1.  The plea\t that the criminal case had ended in\nacquittal and that therefore the civil suit must follow suit\nwas rightly  rejected by  the Tribunal\tand the\t High Court.\n[102 E]\n     2. The  requirement of  culpable rashness undersection\n304AI.P.C. is more drastic than negligence sufficient under\nthe law of tort to create liability. [102 E]\n     The Accident  Tribunal must  take special\tcare to\t see\nthat innocent  victims do  not suffer and drivers and owners\ndo not escape liability merely because of some doubt here or\nsome obscurity\tthere. Save in plain cases, culpability must\nbe inferred  from  the\tcircumstances  where  it  is  fairly\nreasonable. The\t court should  not succumb  to niceties\t and\ntechnicalities. [102 G]\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Special  Leave  Petition\nNos. 937-939 of 1980.From the  Judgment and  Order  dated  1-8-1979  of\t the\nMadras High Court in A.A.O. Nos. 815-817 of 1977.T. A. Ramachandran and K. Ramkumar for the Petitioner.\n     The Order of the Court was delivered by\n     KRISHNA IYER, J.-Sri Ramachandran, ably assisted by Sri\nK. Ram\tKumar, presented  the case  of\tthe  petitioner\t for\nspecial leave, as persuasively as the facts permit but while\nwe were impressed with the102industry and  advocacy of  counsel, we heartily dismiss this\npetition. Why  heartily? Because  the High Court, if at all,\nhas erred in favour of the petitioner, not against him.The Facts: A stage carriage belonging to the petitioner\nwas on\ta trip\twhen, after  nightfall, the bus hit an over-\nhanging high  tension wire  resulting in  26  casualties  of\nwhich 8 proved instantaneously fatal. A criminal case ensued\nbut the\t accused-driver was  acquitted on the score that the\ntragedy that  happened was  an act  of\tGod!  The  Accidents\nClaims Tribunal,  which tried  the claims  for\tcompensation\nunder theMotor  Vehicles  Act,  came\tto  the\t conclusion,\naffirmed by the High Court, that, despite the screams of the\npassengers about  the dangerous over-hanging wire ahead, the\nrash driver  sped towards  the lethal  spot. Some lost their\nlives instantly; several lost their limbs likewise. The High\nCourt, after examining the materials, concluded:\"We therefore\t sustain the finding of the Tribunal\n     that the  accident had  taken place due to the rashness\n     and negligence  of R.W. 1 (driver) and consequently the\n     appellant is  vicariously liable to pay compensation to\n     the claimant.\"The plea  that the  criminal case had ended in acquittal and\nthat, therefore,  the  civil  suit  must  follow  suit,\t was\nrejected and  rightly. The  requirement of culpable rashness\nundersection  304AI.P.C.  is more  drastic than negligence\nsufficient under  the law  of tort  to create liability. The\nquantum of  compensation was  moderately fixed\tand although\nthere was,  perhaps a  case for\t enhancement, the High Court\ndismissed the cross-claims also. Being questions of fact, we\nare  obviously\t unwilling  to\t re-open  the\tholdings  on\nculpability and compensation.Road accidents  are one  of  the  top  killers  in\t our\ncountry,  specially  when  truck  and  bus  drivers  operate\nnocturnally. This  proverbial recklessness  often  persuades\nthe courts,  as has  been observed  by us  earlier in  other\ncases, to draw an initial presumption in several cases based\non the\tdoctrine of  res ipsa  loquitur. Accidents Tribunals\nmust take  special care\t to see that innocent victims do not\nsuffer and drivers and owners do not escape liability merely\nbecause of  some doubt here or some obscurity there. Save in\nplain  cases,\tculpability  must   be\tinferred   from\t the\ncircumstances where  it\t is  fairly  reasonable.  The  court\nshould not  succumb to\tniceties, technicalities  and mystic\nmaybes. We  are emphasising this aspect because we are often\ndistressed by  transport  operators  getting  away  with  it\nthanks to judicial laxity, despite the fact that they do not\nexercise sufficient disciplinary control over the drivers in\nthe matter of careful driving. The heavy economic103impact of  culpable driving  of public\ttransport must bring\nowner  and   driver  to\t  their\t responsibility\t  to   their\n'neighbour'. Indeed,  the State\t must seriously consider no-\nfault liability\t by legislation. A second aspect which pains\nus is  the inadequacy of the compensation or undue parsimony\npractised by  tribunals.  We  must  remember  that  judicial\ntribunals  are\t State\torgans\t andArticle\t41of\t the\nConstitution lays  the jurisprudential\tfoundation for state\nrelief against\taccidental disablement of citizens. There is\nno justification  for niggardliness in compensation. A third\nfactor which  is harrowing is the enormous delay in disposal\nof  accident   cases  resulting\t in  compensation,  even  if\nawarded, being\tpostponed by  several years. The States must\nappoint sufficient  number of  tribunals and the High Courts\nshould insist  upon quick  disposals so\t that the trauma and\ntragedy already\t sustained  may\t not  be  magnified  by\t the\ninjustice of  delayed  justice.\t Many  States  are  unjustly\nindifferent in this regard.We have  been  taken  through  a  few  intricate  legal\nsubmissions by\tcounsel but  we decline\t  to interfere underArticle 136of\t the  Constitution  especially\twhere  human\nmisery is pitted against operational negligence.P.B.R.\t\t\t\t\t Petition dismissed.104"

NO. 2023 OF 2007\n\n\nMAHADEV PRASAD KAUSHIK                 ... APPELLANT\n\nVERSUS\n\nSTATE OF U.P. & ANR.                   ... RESPONDENTS\n\n\n               J U D G M E N TC.K. THAKKER, J.1.       Leave granted.2.       The   present   appeal   is   filed    by   the\n\nappellant herein-a Medical Practitioner, being\n\naggrieved   and    dissatisfied   with    the    order\n\npassed by the Additional Judicial Magistrate-IV, Mathura on January 09, 2007 in Case No. 28of 2006 and confirmed by the High Court of\n\nJudicature at Allahabad on February 09, 2007 in\n\nCriminal Revision No. 366 of 2007. By the said2orders, the courts below issued summons to the\n\nappellant for commission of offences punishable\n\nunderSections 304,504and506, Indian Penal\n\nCode (`IPC' for short).3.        Briefly stated, the facts of the case\n\nare   that   the   appellant   herein   is     a   Medical\n\nPractitioner.      It is the case of respondent No.\n\n2     -   complainant,       resident    of        village\n\nAmanullahpur,      Police   Station   Surir,       District\n\nMathura that he is residing at the aforesaid\n\nplace. That the father of the complainant had\n\npain in his body. On July 04, 2001 at about\n\n6.00 p.m., therefore, the complainant brought\n\nhis father Buddha Ram to the clinic of the\n\nappellant herein for treatment. According to\n\nthe   complainant,    treatment   was   given       by   the\n\nappellant who administered three injections to\n\nBuddha Ram. Within half an hour, Buddha Ram\n\ndied. The appellant asked the complainant to\n\nremove the dead-body of Buddha Ram immediately\n\nand also threatened the complainant not to take\n\nany action against the appellant.34.        It is the case of the complainant that\n\nhe immediately went to Surir Police Station to\n\nlodge a report against the appellant but the\n\npolice    refused          to    register   any     case.   He,\n\ntherefore, filed a complaint in the Court of\n\nAdditional Judicial Magistrate III, Mathura on\n\nJanuary 03, 2002.               In the said complaint, the\n\nabove facts had been stated by the complainant.\n\nA     prayer        was,    therefore,      made     to     take\n\nappropriate action against the appellant-doctor\n\nfor offences punishable underSections 304,504and506, IPC.5.        It was alleged that on July 04, 2001,\n\nthe father of the complainant died because of\n\nnegligence on the part of the appellant.                      It\n\nwas    also    stated       in    the   complaint    that   the\n\ncomplainant went to villege Khaira on August\n\n20, 2001. In the morning at about 8.00 a.m.,\n\nthe appellant-accused met the complainant near\n\nPuran    Tea    stall       and    abused   the    complainant\n\nstating as to why he had filed a complaint\n\nagainst       the     appellant.         According     to    the4complainant,            the       appellant          also      took        out    a\n\nrevolver and threatened the complainant to kill\n\nhim unless he would withdraw the complaint.                                      It\n\nwas stated by the complainant that since the\n\npolice       refused          to    lodge          report      against       the\n\nappellant,             he    was     constrained              to    file     the\n\ncomplaint. A prayer was, therefore, made to the\n\nCourt     to       direct          Police          Station,         Surir        to\n\nregister       a       complaint         of    the       complainant,            to\n\ntake     up    investigation                  and       take       appropriate\n\nlegal steps against the appellant.6.            An       order       was   passed          by    the     learned\n\nMagistrate under sub-section (3) ofSection 156of     the     Code          of     Criminal             Procedure,         1973\n\n(hereinafter                referred          to        as     `CrPC')       and\n\ninvestigation was directed to be made by the\n\nPolice Authorities.                  The Police Authorities, as\n\nper the said direction made the inquiry and\n\nsubmitted          a    final       report         underSection      169,\n\nCrPC on May 27, 2002 stating therein that no\n\noffence       had       been       committed            by   the     appellant\n\nherein.        In           the    report,         it    was       inter    alia5observed that Buddha Ram had suffered \"heart\n\nattack\"     and   he    died       during    the    course      of\n\n\"transit\"    from      village      Khaira    before      he    was\n\nbrought to the clinic of Dr. Mahadev-appellant\n\nherein. It was also observed that it had not\n\ncome on record that the deceased had taken any\n\ntreatment     from      Dr.     Mahadev      nor    there       was\n\nanything to show that Dr. Mahadev administered\n\nthreat to the complainant. The investigation\n\nwas, therefore, closed.7.         According      to    the    complainant,         since\n\nthe final report submitted by the Police was\n\nbiased,     factually         incorrect      and    had        been\n\nprepared     only      with    a    view     to    favour      the\n\nappellant herein, Protest Petition was filed by\n\nthe complainant which was registered as Case\n\nNo. 120 of 2007 by the Court.                In the Protest\n\nPetition, it was asserted by the complainant\n\nthat his father Budha Ram had no heart trouble\n\nat all. Buddha Ram was taken to the clinic of\n\nthe   appellant.          The      appellant       gave     three6injections to Buddha Ram and within half an\n\nhour, the colour of his body went blue and he\n\ndied    in   the   clinic    of   the    appellant.      The\n\nappellant      also    threatened        the   complainant\n\nordering him to take away dead body of Buddha\n\nRam    immediately.        It   was,    therefore,    prayed\n\nthat the final report submitted by the Police\n\nAuthorities should not be accepted and the case\n\nmay be decided in accordance with law.8.           The   learned      Magistrate     heard     the\n\nparties.      After   perusing     the     complaint    and\n\nrecording statements underSection 200of the\n\nCrPC, the learned Magistrate observed that from\n\nthe    statements     of    the   complainant     Devendra\n\nKumar as also PW 1 Har Dayal, PW 2 Gopal Prasad\n\nand PW 3 Shiv Devi, it was clear that on July\n\n04, 2001, at about 6.00 p.m., the father of the\n\ncomplainant got indisposed and was taken to the\n\nclinic of appellant-Dr. Mahadev with the help\n\nof other village persons.          Buddha Ram was given\n\nthree injections and within a short time, body\n\nof Buddha Ram turned into blue colour and he7died.       According to the learned Magistrate, the\n\nallegation of the complainant was supported by\n\neye-witnesses.9.           The    Court   also    noted   that   newspaper\n\nreports revealed that the Chief Medical Officer\n\nand District Collector passed orders pursuant\n\nto which the clinic of Dr. Mahadev was closed.\n\nIt    was    also    alleged       that   Dr.   Mahadev   was\n\nstocking poisonous injections and illegal drugs\n\nin    his      clinic.       The     learned     Magistrate,\n\ntherefore, observed that there was sufficient\n\nevidence to call upon the accused as to what he\n\nhad to say in the case.10.          Being aggrieved by the said order, the\n\nappellant preferred Revision Petition No. 368\n\nof 2007, which was dismissed by the High Court\n\nby a brief order.           The said order is challenged\n\nby the appellant in the present appeal.11.          Notice was issued by this Court and\n\nconsidering        the   nature      of   proceedings,    the\n\nRegistry was directed to place the matter for8final hearing. That is how the matter has been\n\nplaced before us.12.       We have heard the learned counsel for\n\nthe parties.13.       The learned counsel for the appellant\n\ncontended      that    no    case    has   been    made    out\n\nagainst him and both the Courts were in error\n\nin issuing process against the appellant for\n\noffences punishable underSections 304,504and506, IPC.      It was submitted that as per Police\n\nReport,   Buddha      Ram    was    suffering     from    heart\n\nailment and died before he reached clinic of\n\nthe appellant. The said report ought to have\n\nbeen accepted by the Court.14.       In     the        alternative,     the     learned\n\ncounsel submitted that serious error of law has\n\nbeen committed by the Courts below in issuing\n\nprocess for commission of offences punishable\n\nunderSections 304,504and506, IPC. It was\n\nsubmitted that so far asSections 504and506,\n\nIPC are concerned, even the learned Magistrate9has not stated anything as to why process for\n\nthe aforesaid two sections should be issued.15.          As    to    issuance     of     process        underSection 304, IPC, the counsel submitted that\n\neven if it is assumed for the sake of argument\n\nthat whatever is stated by the complainant is\n\ntrue, the appellant is a Doctor and it is well-\n\nestablished         that      in      exercise        of      his\n\nprofessional conduct"
