He  bolted\nthe door from inside, completely stripped off himself,\tmade\nPW.  13\t completely  naked and asked  her  to  do  fellatio.\nThereafter he slightly inserted his penis into her vulva and\nlay  over her. After sometime he freed the child. While\t she\nwas leaving the drawing hall, the respondent threatened\t her\nnot  to\t disclose  his\taffairs\t to  anyone.  She,  however,\nnarrated the incident to respondent's niece.\n     In the evening PW. 13 told her mother (PW. 6) that\t the\nrespondent  had asked her to suck his private part. She did\nnot  narrate  the whole incident out of fear. The  next\t day\nwhen  PW.  13  and respondent's niece were  talking  of\t the\nincident,  their friend PW. 12 came there. PW.\t13  narrated\nthe  incident  to her and other girl friends. On  the  third\nday,  PW.  13  told the entire incident to  her\t mother\t who\nconveyed it to her neighbours PWs. 9 and 10 on telephone. At\nabout  9 p.m. when the appellant (PW.5), the father  of\t the\nvictim girl, returned home and learnt about the\t occurrence,\nhe  accompanied\t by  PWs. 7,9 and 10  went  to\trespondent's\nhouse,\tbut he was not there and they informed\tthe  brother\nand sister-in-law of the respondent of the purpose of  their\nvisit.\tThey  all  waited  there  till\tmidnight  when\t the\nrespondent  came. The respondent, assessing  the  situation,\nvoluntarily  confessed his crime. He admitted that he  raped\nPW.  13\t and  also  committed  the  same  crime\t on  earlier\noccasions with his niece and other minor girls, but being  a\ndoctor\the  had\t been careful enough not  to  rupture  their\nhymen.\tThe  brother of the respondent begged of PW.  5\t and\nothers\tnot to do anything till the arrival of his  parents.\nNext  morning  when respondent's parents reached,  he  again\nadmitted his abominable crime of sexual assault on PW. 13.\n     It\t took  2-3  days  more to PW. 5\t to  get  a  written\ncomplaint  (Ext. P.7) lodged with the police through PW.  8.\nThe  police  investigation culminated in the  trial  of\t the\nrespondent for an offence of rape committed on PW. 13.\n     The  trial court held that the prosecution against\t the\nrespondent  was launched due to some enmity between the\t two\nfamilies and that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t       923\nprosecution  did  not  adduce any  acceptable  evidence\t for\nholding\t the respondent guilty of offence unders. 376IPC.\nIt accordingly acquitted the respondent.\n     The  State\t filed an appeal an  against  the  acquittal\nbefore the High Court. The complainant-appellant also  filed\na criminal revision challenging the legality of the order of\nacquittal.  On\tthe  basis of an  artical  relating  to\t the\nincident  published  in a foreign magazine, a  petition\t was\naddressed  to the Chief Justice of India with a copy to\t the\nChief Justice  of the High Court concerned and on its  basis\nanother criminal revision petition was registered. The\tHigh\nCourt disposed of all the three cases by a common  judgment.\nIt accepted the oral testimony of prosecution witnesses\t and\nthe  extra-judicial confession made by the  respondent.\t It,\nhowever,  held the respondent guilty of an offence under  s.\n354IPCand sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 3,000  only.\nThe complainant-appellant filed the appeal by special  leave\nto this Court.\tThe State did not file any appeal.\n     It\t was contended on behalf of the appellant  that\t the\nHigh Court erred in holding the respondent guilty of a minor\noffence unders. 354IPC when all the necessary\t ingredients\nto  constitute\tan offence punishable unders. 376IPC\t had\nbeen  satisfactorily established; and the sentence  of\tfine\nalone  imposed was grossly inadequate and  not\tcommensurate\nwith the gravity of the offence committed by the respondent.\n     Allowing  the appeal and setting aside the judgment  of\nthe High Court, this Court,\n     HELD   :\t1.  The\t  prosecution\thas   satisfactorily\nestablished  its case that the respondent committed rape  on\nPW. 13 by proving all the necessary ingredients required  to\nmake  out  an offence of rape punishable underSection\t 376IPC. [p. 947 B]\n     2. When the evidence of PW. 13-that the respondent\t put\nhis  male  organ  inside her vagina  and  clutched  her\t and\nthereafter  she suffered pain-is taken with the evidence  of\nmedical officer who found an abrasion on the medical side of\nlabia  majora and redness present around the  labia   minora\nwith  white  discharge even after 5 days, it can  be  safely\nconcluded  that\t there was partial  penetration\t within\t the\nlabia  majora  or the vulva or pudenda which  in  the  legal\nsense is sufficient to constitute the offence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t       924\nrape.  Moreover,  the  respondent  himself  confessed  twice\nadmitting the commission of rape without rupturing the hymen\nwhich  confession is not disbelieved by the High Court.\t [p.\n946 C; E-F]\n     3.1.  The evidence of PW. 13 is amply corroborated\t not\nonly by the medical evidence and the evidence of PW. 12\t but\nalso  by the  plenary confession of the respondent  himself.\n[p. 947 A]\n     3.2  Even\tin  cases  wherein there  is  lack  of\toral\ncorroboration to that of a prosecutrix, a conviction can  be\nsafely\trecorded, provided the evidence of the\tvictim\tdoes\nnot suffer from any basic infirmity, and the  `probabilities\nfactor' does not render it unworthy of credence, and that as\na  general  rule,  corroboration cannot\t be  insisted  upon,\nexcept\tfrom the medical evidence, where, having  regard  to\nthe  circumstances  of\tthe case, medical  evidence  can  be\nexpected to be forthcoming.

WADHWA, J.leave granted\n     Rajendra Jawanmal Gandhi (the accused) was convicted by\nthe Sessions  Judge, Satara  for offences  underSection 376Indian Penal  Code  (IPC)  andSection\t 57of\t the  Bombay\nChildren Act,  1948 for\t having committed  rape on a girl of\neight  years  of  age  and  sentenced  to  undergo  rigorous\nimprisonment for  7 years  and to pay fine of Rs.5,000/- and\nin  default   of  payment   of\tfine   to  undergo  rigorous\nimprisonment for six months and for offence underSection 57of the\tBombay Children\t Act, he  was sentenced\t to  undergo\nrigorous imprisonment  for one year and fine of Rs.500/- and\nin default  thereof rigorous  imprisonment for one moth. The\nsubstantive sentences  were  ordered  to  urn  concurrently.\nMaruti car  in which  the offence  of rape was committed was\nordered to  be forfeited  and confiscated  to the State. The\naccused appealed  to  the  Bombay  High\t Court\tagainst\t his\nconviction and\tsentence. A Division Bench of the High Court\nby judgment  dated October  4, 1994 upheld the conviction of\nthe accused  underSection 57of the Bombay Children Act and\nupset the  conviction underSection  376IPC\tand  instead\nconvicted him  for an  offence underSection  354IPC\t and\nsentenced him  to suffer  rigorous imprisonment which he had\nalready undergone (which was 33 days in all) and to pay fine\nof Rs.40,000/-.\t In default  of payment of fine, the accused\nwas sentenced  to undergo  rigorous imprisonment  for  three\nmonths. It  was ordered\t that our of the fine so realised, a\nsum of\tRs.25,000/- shall  be paid  to the complaint who was\nfather of  the girl.  For an offence underSection 57of the\nBombay Children\t Act, sentence\twas reduced  to imprisonment\nalready undergone  and the  accused not\t required to undergo\nany separate  imprisonment for\tthis offence. The Maruti Car\nwas ordered  to be  returned to the accused and the order of\nforfeiture and confiscation was set aside.The matter\t did not  end at  that. Nagrik Kirti Samiti,\nKolhapur which\thad  been  formed  was\tagitated  about\t the\nacquittal of  the accused  for an  offence underSection 376IPC. The Convener of the Samiti Mr. P.D. Hankare represented\nto the\tState Government  to file  an appeal  to this  Court\nagainst the  acquittal of the accused underSection 376IPC.\nIn the\tmeantime, the  accused had  deposited  the  fine  of\nRs.40,000/- as\tordered by  the High  Court and\t our of this\namount a sum of Rs.25,000/- has been withdrawn by the father\nof the\tgirl. Perhaps  this was\t the consideration  for\t the\nState Government  not to  file any  appeal  in\tthe  Supreme\nCourt.\tSince\tthere  was   no\t response   from  the  State\nGovernment, Mr.\t P.D. Hankare, Convener of the Nagarik Kirti\nSamiti, Kolhapur  approached  this  Court.  He\twas  granted\npermission  to\tfile  special  leave  petition\tagainst\t the\nconviction and sentence on the accused by the High Court and\nas afore  mentioned, after  notice of this appeal was served\nupon the  State of  Maharashtra and  the accused, both filed\nseparate  appeals   in\tthis   Court,  while  the  State  of\nMaharashtra filed appeal against the conviction and sentence\nof the\taccused by the High Court praying for his conviction\nunderSection 376IPC and for enhancement of his sentence of\nminimum of  10 years,  the accused  filed appeal against his\nvery conviction and sentence underSection 354IPC and 57 of\ntheBombay Children  Act.Since the\tState itself has filed an appeal praying for\nconviction of  the accused underSection 376IPC and for his\npunishment under  Section 376(f)  as the girl child was less\nthan 12\t years\tof  age,  leave\t granted  to  P.D.  Hankare,\nConvener,  Nagrik   Kirti   Samiti,   Kolhapur\t Loses\t its\nsignificance and we direct that the leave be revoked.It may  be noticed\t at the\t outset that the offence was\ncommitted at  Kolhapur and the accused was to be tried there\nin the\tcourt of  Session.
