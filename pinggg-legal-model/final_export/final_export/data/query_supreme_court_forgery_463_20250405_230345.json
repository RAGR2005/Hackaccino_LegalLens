It is further stated that at the time of ECS\n        transfer, these amounts were transferred to the accounts opened in the\n        name of accused Vikas Rana. On preliminary enquiry, it has been found\n        that this practice has been taking place since 2005 when Electronic\n        Clearance System (ECS) was introduced in the PMO. On the complaint\n        of Sh. K. Salil Kumar, the present FIR has been registered at PS\n        Parliament Street. Subsequently on 19.01.2009, the present case was\n        transferred to Cyber Cell, Economic Wing, Crime Branch, New Delhi\n        and during the course of investigation on 02.04.2009,section 13(1)(c)and (d) POC Act were added.            Statement of complainant was also\n        recorded and some documents were also obtained from the complainant\n        and on examination of the documents as well as the statements of the\n        witnesses, it was revealed that the accused who was appointed as LDC\n        and later on promoted as UDC in CSCS cadre of Ministry of Home\n        Affairs was assigned duties of cash and general section of PMO and was\n        deputed to prepare salary of the Ministerial­1 staff category and used to\n        prepare the monthly salary bills of the staff of the Ministerial­1 through\n        the computer software installed and maintained at NIC of PMO. The\n        accused was assigned duty to prepare the salary bills utilizing the\n        computer software. The accused and other clerk used to feed data in the\n        software maintained at PMO, NIC server through internal computer\n        network connection. The accused used to take the printout of the salary\n        bills of Ministerial­1 staff and then used to put up the same before the\n        Section Officer/DDO of cash and General Section of PMO and Section\n        Officer/DDO then used to authenticate them by signing the bills.

The bank account number and other bank details\n        of the each official were also maintained in the salary software so that\n        the salary could be deposited in the respective bank account through\n        ECS.    All the details/data relating to the salary disbursement was\n        downloaded in a CD in encrypted format at NIC Section of PMO where\n        all the server computer of PMO were installed.        CD alongwith the\n        cheque of salary amount was then sent to Punjab National Bank,\n        Parliament Street, New Delhi and PNB then forwarded it to the ECS\n        Department, Reserve Bank of India.

This is a petition to quash the proceedings in C.C. No. 341 of 1979 on the file of the Court of the V Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad.2. A private complaint was filed before the V Metropolitan Magistrate Hyderabad. It was sent for investigation under S. 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. The Station House Officer, Nampally Police Station, after due investigation, filed the charge-sheet against the accused for offences punishable under sections 120-B, 468 and 471 of the I.P.C.3. The case of the prosecution is that the complainant is the owner of the shops bearing municipal Nos. 5-7-568 to 5-7-575, situated at Nampally, Hyderabad and that A-3 and A-4 are the tenants. A-1 is the son of A-2. They have cloth business opposite to the shop of the owner i.e. the complainant. The complainant wanted to sell the shops as he was getting very low rent and he made this known to some of the accused. Therefore, A-3 and A-4 were afraid that the shops would be purchased by somebody else and A-3 and A-4 would be asked to vacate these shops. Therefore, A-1 and A-2 with the evil intention of getting the shop for a negligible price' conspired with A-3 and A-4 and fabricated a document by using a revenue stamp containing the signature of the complainant in the Rokad of A-1 and also brought into existence a forged receipt for a sum of Rs. 10,000/-. On the basis of this document, A-1 filed a suit for specific performance of the agreement of sale. On the basis of the above facts mentioned in the charge-sheet, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 468 and 471 I.P.C.4. In this petition Mr. Somakonda Reddy, the learned advocate, strenuously contends that having regard to the provisions ofS. 195(1)(b)(ii)of the Cr.P.C. the private complainant of the SHO, Nampally Police Station, cannot file the charge-sheet. If at all, a complaint would be filed in writing by the court before which the civil suit for specific performance of the agreement of sale on the basis of the alleged forged document is pending. The learned advocate further submits that although the offence punishable underS. 468I.P.C., is not specifically mentioned inS. 195(1)(b)(ii), Cr.P.C. nevertheless, having regard to the opening phrase \"of any offence described inS. 463\" found in Clause (ii) ofSection 195(1)(b)Cr.P.C., the offence punishable underS. 468I.P.C. would also come within the category of the offence described inS. 463. So far asSection 120-B, I.P.C. is concerned, Mr. Somakonda Reddy states thatS. 195(1)(b)(ii)Cr.P.C. specifically provides for that offence. Therefore, submits the learned advocate that so far as these offences are concerned, the trial court has taken cognizance of the offence punishable underSections 120-B,468and471I.P.C., on the basis of the charge-sheet filed by the police, whereas all these three Sections are found inS. 195(1)(b)(ii)and (iii)Cr.P.C. and, therefore, since the prosecution has not been laid on the basis of a complaint in writing by the civil court before which the alleged document is pending decision, the proceedings are liable to be quashed.5. Mr. Padmanabha Reddy, the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the private complainant, contends that a perusal ofS. 195(1)(b)(ii)Cr.P.C. would show that only those offences which are described inS. 463I.P.C., and mentioned specifically as punishable underSections 471,475orS. 476are the only offences for which the court can take cognizance of on the basis of the complaint in writing of that court before which the civil suit is pending. Therefore, sinceSections 468,120-Bread with 468 are involved in this case, with regard to whichS. 195(1)(b)(ii)Cr.P.C., is completely silent, the trial court was correct in taking cognizance of the offence punishable under sections 120-B and468. So far asSection 471is concerned, Mr. Padmanabha Reddy contends that,Section 471as mentioned in sub-clause (ii) ofS. 195(1)(b)only applies to the parties to the document and to no other person. Hence, he submits that the proceedings should not be quashed.In support of his contention, Mr. Padmanabha Reddy has cited :Govind Mehta v. State of Bihar.and Yellappa Gowder v. State of Karnataka, 1977 Mad LJ (Cri) 20 : (1977 Cri LJ NOC 154) (Kant).6. Mr. Somakonda Reddy has cited the following rulings :Assistant Sessions Judge, North, Arcot v. Ramammal, (1913) ILR 36 Mad 387 : (13 Cri LJ 85); Montajaddin v. Emporor, AIR 1938 Cal 481 : (34 Cri LJ 526) and Dena Nath v. Hansraj, 1974 Cri LJ 198 (J and K).7. I am of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the provisions of law involved, that the contention advanced by Mr. Somakonda Reddy has to be accepted.8. In this case, we are not concerned withSection 195(1)(a), but are concerned withS. 195(1)(b)(ii)and (iii), which provides as follows :-\"195(1). No Court shall take cognizance - (b)(ii) of any offence described in S. 463, or punishable under S. 471, S, 475 or S. 476, of the said Code, when such an offence is alleged to have been committed in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court, or(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit, or attempt to commit, or the abetment of, any offence specified in sub-clause (i) or sub-clause (ii), except on the complaint in writing of that Court or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate.\"A plain reading of this Section would show that for offences mentioned in clause (b)(ii) and (iii) ofS. 195(1), Cr.P.C. the Court can take cognizance of those offences only when the complaint is in writing filed by the Court or some other Court to which that court is subordinate, before which the document in question is found to be forged one and the accused before that Court are found to have committed any offence. In the instant case, on the basis of the alleged forged document, the accused have filed a suit in the civil court. Therefore, it would be the civil court which would be the proper complainant in this case and not a private individual or the police. As pointed out above, the trial court has taken, cognizance of the offence punishable under Ss. 120-B, 468 and 471 I.P.C. S. 195(1)(b)(iii) applies to S. 120-B, I.P.C. specifically and similarly S. 195(1)(b)(ii) also includes specifically the offence punishable under S. 471, I.P.C. Therefore, so for as these offences are concerned, taking cognizance by the Court is hit by the provisions of S. 195(1)(b)(ii) and (iii) Cr.P.C.The main dispute centres roundS. 468I.P.C. which is being attracted in respect of commission of offence of forgery for the purpose of cheating. Mr. Padmanabha Reddy contends that, having regard to the phrase \"of any offence described inSection 463\" only those offences of forgery simpliciter as mentioned inSection 463I.P.C., will be hit by the provisions ofS. 195(1)(b)(ii)Cr.P.C. and not offences punishable underS. 468, I.P.C., becauseS. 468has not specifically been mentioned in sub-clause (ii) or Clause (b) ofSection 195(1)Cr.P.C. In support of this contention Mr. Padmanabha Reddy relied on a ruling of the Supreme Court reported inGovind Mehta v. State of Bihar, (1971 Cri LJ 1266) (supra). It is true that I am bound by the ruling of the Supreme Court. But, in order to be bound, it is necessary that the Supreme Court had applied its mind and had considered the provisions of law, and had given a considered opinion on that point of law. But, where the Supreme Court decides a case on the basis of a concession or admission made by an advocate on behalf of a party, then, in that case, the effect of such a decision would not be so potent as one based on a consideration of a question of law involved.It is to be noted that inGovind Mehta's case, the Supreme Court has held in paragraph 14 as follows :-\"We have already referred to the Sections of the Penal Code under which the appellant has been charged. They areSections 167,466and471. Admittedly, none of these sections is covered by Clause (b) ofS. 195(1). Therefore, Clause (b) prima facie will not in terms bar the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence underS. 167of the Penal Code.\" In para. 15, the Supreme Court held :\"The offence under S, 466 of the Penal Code, is, admittedly, not covered by clause (b) or Clause (c) ofS. 195(1)of the Code. Therefore, that Section does not operate as a bar in respect of this offence.\"It would be noticed that the decision in this case was on the basis of an admission made by the counsel and not on a consideration of the provisions ofS. 195(1)(b)(ii)and specifically the phrase appearing in sub-clause (ii) viz., \"of any offence described inS. 463\". I am of the opinion thatS. 463defines a forgery simpliciter whereas the following Sections i.e.,Sections 465,466,467,468,469,470and471define an aggravated form of forgery. Hence, to my mind, the Supreme Court ruling does not help the respondent in this case; and in the light of the phrase \"of any offence described inS. 463\"Section 468also will be hit by the provisions ofS. 195(1)(b)(ii)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. I am supported in my view by a judgment of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court inDena Nath v. Hansraj, (1974 Cri LJ 198) (supra).9. So far as the offence punishable underSection 471is concerned, the phrase \"by a party to any proceedings in any Court\", appearing inS. 195(1)(c)of the oldCr.P.C., is not to be found in the newCr.P.C. and instead, the words \"when such an offence is alleged to have been committed in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court\", now appear. Therefore, in the light of this amendment, th"
