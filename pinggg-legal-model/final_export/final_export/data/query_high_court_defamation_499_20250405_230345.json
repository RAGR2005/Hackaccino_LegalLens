The appellant is a well known actress who has approached\n\nthis Court to seek quashing of criminal proceedings pending\n\nagainst her. As many as 23 Criminal Complaints were filed\n\nagainst her, mostly in the State of Tamil Nadu, for the\n\noffences contemplated underSections 499,500and505of\n\nthe    Indian     Penal     Code,        1860           [hereinafter       `IPC']       andSections 4and6of the Indecent Representation of Women\n\n(Prohibition)       Act,       1986       [hereinafter            `Act    1986'].       The\n\ntrigger    for     the     same       were       some      remarks       made    by     the\n\nappellant in an interview to a leading news magazine and\n\nlater on the same issue was reported in a distorted manner\n\nin     another    periodical.            Faced      with      the    predicament        of\n\ncontesting the criminal proceedings instituted against her\n\nin several locations, the appellant had approached the High\n\nCourt     of     Madras,       praying        for       the   quashing      of        these\n\nproceedings       through      the       exercise        of   its     inherent        power\n\nunderSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n[hereinafter `Cr.PC.']. The High Court rejected her plea\n\nvide impugned judgment and order dated 30.4.2008. At the\n\nsame    time,     in     order      to     prevent         the      inconvenience        of2litigating       the   same   subject-matter          in    multiple   locations\n\ndirected     that      all    the       cases      instituted     against       the\n\nappellant be consolidated and tried together by the Chief\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate, Egmore (Chennai). Aggrieved by the\n\naforesaid judgment,           the appellant approached this Court by\n\nway of a batch of Special Leave Petitions.3. Before addressing the legal aspects of the case before\n\nus, it would be useful to examine the relevant facts. In\n\nSeptember 2005, `India Today' a fortnightly news magazine\n\nhad conducted a survey on the subject of the sexual habits\n\nof people residing in the bigger cities of India. One of\n\nthe   issues      discussed        as    part   of    this    survey     was    the\n\nincreasing incidence of pre-marital sex. As a part of this\n\nexercise, the magazine had gathered and published the views\n\nexpressed by several individuals from different segments of\n\nsociety, including those of the appellant. The appellant\n\nexpressed her personal opinion wherein she had noted the\n\nincreasing incidence of pre-marital sex, especially in the\n\ncontext     of    live-in      relationships          and     called     for    the\n\nsocietal    acceptance        of    the   same.      However,    appellant      had\n\nalso qualified her remarks by observing that girls should\n\ntake adequate precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancies\n\nand   the   transmission       of       venereal     diseases.    This    can    be3readily inferred from the statement which was published, a\n\nrough translation of which is reproduced below:\"According to me, sex is not only concerned with\n     the body; but also concerned with the conscious.\n     I could not understand matters such as changing\n     boyfriends every week. When a girl is committed\n     to   her boyfriend, she can tell her parents and\n     go out with him. When their daughter is having a\n     serious relationship, the parents should allow\n     the same. Our society should come out of the\n     thinking that at the time of the marriage, the\n     girls should be with virginity.None of the educated men, will expect that the\n     girl whom they are marrying should be with\n     virginity. But when having sexual relationship\n     the   girls   should   protect   themselves from\n     conceiving and getting venereal diseases.\"These   remarks   were   published   alongside    a   survey,   the\n\nrelevant extracts of which are stated below:\"Will you marry a      person   who   had   relationship\n     with    others?18% - Yes, 71% - No\n\n     Is it necessary to be a virgin till the time of\nmarriage?65% - Yes, 26% - No\n\n     The remaining percentage of people said: Do not\n     know/Cannot say\n\n     82% women had given an opinion that a girl should\n     be a virgin at the time of marriage.\"4. Subsequently, `Dhina Thanthi', a Tamil daily carried a\n\nnews item on 24.9.2005 which first quoted the appellant's\n\nstatement published in `India Today' and then opined that4it had created a sensation all over the State of Tamil\n\nNadu. This news item also reported a conversation between\n\nthe    appellant     and   a   correspondent    from    `Dhina   Thanthi',\n\nwherein the appellant had purportedly defended her views in\n\nthe following manner (rough translation reproduced below):\"The persons who are protesting against my\n       interview, are talking about which culture? Is\n       there anyone who does not know about sex in Tamil\n       Nadu? Is there anyone who does not know about\n       AIDS? How many men and women do not have sex\n       before marriage?Why are people saying that after the marriage the\n       husband and wife should be honest and faithful to\n       each other? One should have confidence in the\n       other, only to avoid the mistakes from being\n       committed. If the husband, without the knowledge\n       of the wife, or the wife, without the knowledge\n       of the husband, have sex with other persons, if a\n       disease is caused through that, the same will\n       affect both the persons. It will also affect the\n       children. Only because of this, they are saying\n       like that.\"However, soon after the publication of the above mentioned\n\nnews   item,   the    appellant    had   sent   a     legal   notice    dated\n\n2.10.2005 to the Editor of `Dhina Thanthi', categorically\n\ndenying that she had made the statement quoted above. In\n\nfact, the appellant had asked the publisher to withdraw the\n\nnews-item      carried     on    24.9.2005      and     to    publish    her\n\nobjections prominently within three days of receipt of the\n\nnotice, failing which the appellant would be constrained to\n\ntake appropriate legal action against the newspaper.55. As outlined above, the publication of these statements\n\nin `India Today' and `Dhina Thanthi' drew criticism from\n\nsome quarters and several persons and organisations filed\n\ncriminal   complaints      against     the    appellant.     For     instance,\n\nthe complainant in the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl) No.\n\n4010 of 2008 has stated that she is a married woman who is\n\nthe Treasurer of a District-level unit of the Pattali Makal\n\nKatchi [hereinafter `PMK'], a political party, and is also\n\ninvolved in social service. She had quoted some parts of\n\nthe   statements    published        in     `India    Today'     and    `Dhina\n\nThanthi'   to    allege    that    the       appellant's    interview       had\n\nbrought great      shame   on    her   since     it   had   suggested      that\n\nw"

JAIN, J.:Leave granted.2. This appeal, by special leave, arises from the judgment dated 18 th\n\n  November 2008 rendered by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of\n\n  Calcutta in C.R.R. No. 523 of 2008. By the impugned judgment, the\n\n  learned Judge has dismissed the petition preferred by the appellants underSection 482of the of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short\n\n   \"the Code\") seeking quashing of a private complaint filed by respondent\n\n   No.2 in this appeal, for an offence under Section 500 read withSection\n\n   34of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short \"theIPC\").3. The facts, material for the purpose of disposal of this appeal, may be\n\n   stated thus:Appellant No.1 is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the\n\nChartered Financial Analysts Institute (hereinafter referred to as \"CFA\n\nInstitute\"), incorporated under the laws of the State of Virginia, United\n\nStates.   Appellant No.2 is the President of the Indian Association of\n\nInvestment Professionals, who is a member of the society of CFA Institute.CFA Institute is a non stock corporation and confers the designation of Chief\n\nFinancial Analyst (\"CFA\" for short) upon its members who fulfil a\n\nminimum professional criterion. CFA certification is considered to be a\n\ndefinitive standard for professional competence.4. In the year 1985, on being approached by the Institute of Chartered\n\n   Financial Analysts of India (for short \"ICFAI\"), respondent No.2 herein,\n\n   a registered society, having its office at Kolkata, CFA Institute entered\n\finto a licence agreement with them to conduct its CFA program in India.\n\nThe agreed arrangement continued for quite some time.            However,\n\nrealising that respondent No.2 was not adhering to the required standards\n\nand quality in the said program, CFA Institute decided to wean off its\n\narrangement with ICFAI - respondent No.2. Since, in the meanwhile,\n\nrespondent No.2 was attempting to get the trademarks of CFA Institute\n\nregistered in India, in the year 1997, CFA Institute issued a notice of\n\ntermination of its licence with the said respondent. On receipt of the said\n\nnotice, respondent No.2 filed a declaratory suit before the District Courts\n\nin Hyderabad, seeking a declaration regarding the change of their name\n\n\"ICFAI\" and their use of the designation \"CFA\". However, they did not\n\nsucceed in getting any interim or final relief in the said suit. In the year\n\n2004, CFA Institute filed a Civil Suit [C.S.(OS) No.210 of 2004] in the\n\nHigh Court of Delhi for permanent injunction restraining respondent\n\nNo.2 from using the trade marks, services, service marks or trade name\n\nCFA, Chartered Financial Analyst, The Institute of Chartered Financial\n\nAnalysts of India, ICFA and ICFAI or any other name or mark which\n\nmay be identical or deceptively similar to these marks and passing off\n\nCFA Institute Programs or business as that of CFA Institute. Vide Order\n\f   dated 4th August 2006, the High Court passed the following order by way\n\n   of interim relief:\"30. In view of the above, I allow the application under Order\n      XXXIX Rules 1 & 2CPCand restrain the defendants, during\n      the pendency of the suit from using any of the trademarks or\n      service marks CFA, Chartered Financial Analyst, The Institute\n      of Chartered Financial Analysts of India, ICFA and ICFAI or\n      any other name or mark which may be identical or deceptively\n      similar to these marks and from passing off their programmes\n      or business as that of the plaintiffs. However, this order of\n      injunction will not come into effect till the end of current\n      academic session of the CFA Programme run by the\n      defendants. Nor will anything said herein will mean final\n      expression of opinion of this Court.\"[Emphasis supplied]5. On 30th January 2007, respondent No.2, through its sponsored University\n\n   in Tripura - The Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India\n\n   University, Tripura (hereinafter referred to as \"the University\"), issued an\n\n   advertisement inviting applications for fresh enrolments for award of\n\n   \"CFA\" certification. According to CFA Institute, since the programmes\n\n   which were current at the time of passing of the order of interim\n\n   injunction by the High Court of Delhi on 4th August 2006 had come to an\n\n   end in January 2007, the invitation for fresh enrolment in terms of the\n\n   advertisement issued on 30th January 2007 was for subsequent\n\fprogrammes, which were not current at the time of the interim injunction\n\norder and, therefore, it was in breach of the said interim injunction.\n\nAccordingly, on 12th February 2007, CFA Institute issued a public notice\n\nunder the caption \"A Word of Caution to the Indian Investment\n\nCommunity\", (hereinafter referred to as \"Word of Caution\").                                                 The\n\nrelevant extract of the said publication reads thus:\"There is confusion over the \"CFA\" name in India, and you\n   deserve to know the facts. The Chartered Financial Analyst\n   (CFA(R)) designation from CFA Institute is the only globally\n   recognized CFA designation for financial professionals.However, the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India\n   (Icfai) offers an educational program specializing in finance,\n   which they term the \"CFA Program\", and awards a title called\n   the \"CFA\".On 4th August 2006, the Delhi High Court recognized that CFA\n   Institute owns the exclusive rights to the CFA trademarks and\n   that continued use by Icfai causes irreparable harm. The court\n   ordered an interim injunction requiring Icfai to stop using the\n   \"Chartered Financial Analyst\" and \"CFA\" brands and to change\n   its corporate and \"CFA\" title names. Unfortunately, Icfai has\n   continued its unauthorized use of our trademarks by running\n   advertisements from an Icfai-sponsored university.\n\n   ................................................................................................................................................................................\n\n   If you are planning to either hire an investment professional or\n   obtain a designation, you need to make informed decision that\n   benefit your future.

Alleging that the said public notice was defamatory within the meaning\n\n   ofSection 499of the IPC, respondent No.2 filed a private complaint\n\n   against the appellants. The trial court took cognizance of the complaint\n\n   and issued summons to the appellants.         Feeling aggrieved by the\n\n   summoning order, the appellants preferred the afore-noted petition before\n\n   the High Court of Calcutta.       As already stated, by the impugned\n\n   judgment, the High Court has dismissed the said petition. Hence, the\n\n   present appeal by the accused.7. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\n   appellants strenuously urged that the High Court gravely erred in\n\n   declining to exercise its jurisdiction underSection 482of the Code in a\n\n   case where the complaint ex facie lacks basic ingredients ofSection 499of the IPC. Learned counsel submitted that by offering a prospectus for a\n\n   new session beginning in the year 2007, which would be of 12-18 months\n\n   duration, the University, a sponsored University of ICFAI had violated\n\n   the injunction order issued by the High Court of Delhi on 4 th August 2006\n\f   and, therefore, in the wake of a misleading advertisement, the appellants\n\n   were compelled to issue a \"Word of Caution\".8. Learned counsel contended that from the provisions of theInstitute of\n\n   Chartered Financial Analysts of India University, Tripura Act, 2004(for\n\n   short \"the Act\"), it was clear that the University was nothing but an alter\n\n   ego of respondent No.2. In support of the contention, learned counsel\n\n   referred to certain provisions of the Act showing that it is respondent\n\n   No.2 who appoints the Chancellor of the University and in turn the\n\n   Chancellor appoints the Vice-Chancellor; underSection 20of the Act,\n\n   the Board of Governors consists of Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and\n\n   three other persons nominated by respondent No.2; underSection 21of\n\n   the Act, the Board of Management consists of 9 persons of whom as\n\n   many as 7 persons are to be the nominees of respondent No.2. It was,\n\n   thus, submitted that all the acts of the University were really the acts of\n\n   respondent No.2 itself and, therefore, the ad"
