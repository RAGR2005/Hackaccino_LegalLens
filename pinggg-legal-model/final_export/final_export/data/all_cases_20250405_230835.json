Government Appeal No. 2239 of 2009 has been filed by the State-appellant challenging the judgment and order dated 16.09.2008 passed by the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, Court No. 1, Hamirpur in Sessions Trial No. 137 of 2005 arising out of Case Crime No. 22 of 2005 underSections 302/34,504,506IPC, Police Station Rath, District Hamirpur whereby both the accused-respondents have been acquitted of all the charges.2. The aforesaid judgment and order dated 16.09.2008 has been assailed by the informant of the case Shyam Singh @ Pappu also by filing Criminal Revision No. 3459 of 2008, and by means of an order dated 19-09-2011, the aforesaid Criminal Revision was connected with Govt. Appeal No. 2239 of 2009.3. Government Appeal No. 2239 of 2009 filed by the State-appellant has been admitted by means of an order dated 04.11.2011.4. As both the aforesaid cases have been filed challenging the judgment and order dated 16.09.2008, both the cases are being decided by a common judgment.Prosecution Case5. Briefly stated, the prosecution case is that on 28.01.2005, the informant Shyam Singh @ Pappu gave a written report at Police Station Rath, stating that a dispute had arisen in his village Nandana between Shiv Kumar and his brother Shiv Narayan, for fixing a gate on a land which belongs to Shiv Narayan. On 28.01.2005 at about 12:00 noon Shiv Kumar asked the Shiv Narayan that he had given an application to the Police regarding the gate put up by the latter and he should stop the work and resume the same only after the Police makes an enquiry. Upon this, Shiv Narayan (the accused-respondent No. 1) and his son Pradeep (the accused-respondent No. 2) started hurling abuses. The informant and his father, who was standing with Shiv Kumar in front of his house, forbade them from doing so. Pradeep shouted from upstairs that all the persons had come for doing a panchayat, shoot them. Upon this Shiv Narayan fired a shot from his licensed double barrel gun which hit the informant's father (Jaswant) in his chest and face. In order to save his life, the informant pulled his father inside the house of Shiv Kumar, but his father died immediately due to the gun-shot injury. The accused-respondents threatened that in case any person lodged a report or gave evidence, he would also be killed and both the accused persons ran away. Shiv Narayan was carrying a double barrel gun and Pradeep was carrying a single barrel gun. The incident was witnessed by Shyam Singh @ Pappu, Shiv Pal Singh son of Badri Prasad, Surjan Singh and the mother of Shyam Singh. Immediately after the incident, Head Constable Chandrabhan and a Constable Raj Singh had reached the village and they got engaged in search of the accused-respondents.6. Upon the aforesaid written information, a Case Crime No. 22 of 2005 underSections 302/34,504,506IPC was registered in Police Station Rath at 12:45 p.m. on 28.01.2005.7. A Sub-Inspector reached the spot of occurrence and prepared an inquest report (Ex.A-5), in which he recorded that the dead body had injury marks on the right side of its face and there was no other apparent injury. However, after writing the inquest report, a line has been inserted in between two lines, stating that the dead body had pellet injuries on its chest in an area of 30 c.m. x 30 c.m. The I.O. collected the clothes worn by the deceased and the samples of blood stained, as well as unstained pieces of cemented floor from inside the house of Shiv Kumar, where the dead body of the deceased was lying. He also recovered an empty cartridge which was lying near the channel gate on the upper floor of the house of the accused Shiv Narayan. The Investigating Officer prepared a site plan, conducted investigation and submitted a charge sheet in the Court, on the basis whereof the accused - respondents were tried for committing offences underSection 302/34,504and506I.P.C..Prosecution Evidence8. During the trial, the prosecution examined the informant Shyam Singh @ Pappu as PW-1, eye-witness Shiv Kumar as PW-2, Head Constable Chandrabhan as PW-3, Dr. R.K. Mishra as PW-4, Head Constable Suresh Kumar as PW-5, S.I. Mohan Lal and PW-6 and Sub Inspector Radhey Shayam Trivedi as PW-7.9. PW-1 Shyam Singh (the informant) stated that on the date of the incident at about 12 noon, he was standing in front of his house, which is opposite the house of Shiv Kumar. Shiv Kumar was also standing outside his house. The informant's father was standing about 6 feet away from Shiv Kumar. The house of the accused persons Shiv Narayan and Pradeep, who are father and son, is about 6-7 steps away from the informant's home. Shiv Kumar is the brother of Shiv Narayan. There is a platform measuring about 30 ft. x 10 ft. in front of the house of Shiv Narayan. Earlier this platform was jointly owned by all the persons. About 10 years ago, a portion of the platform measuring 10 ft. x 10 ft. was given to Shiv Narayan. On the date of the incident Shiv Narayan was putting up a gate by encroaching upon an area in excess of his portion of the platform. The informant's father Jaswant and Shiv Kumar had restrained him from putting up the gate. At that time, Pradeep and Shiv Narayan were standing inside the channel gate at the first floor of their house. Referring to the informant's father and Shiv Kumar, the accused-respondent no. 2 Pradeep exhorted to the accused--respondent no. 1 Shiv Narayan that \"bade panch bante hain, goli maar do\" meaning that the aforesaid persons were acting as panchs (arbitrators) and he should shoot them. Upon this Shiv Narayan fired a shot from his double barrel gun aimed at the informants' father and the pellets hit his chest and the face. Pradeep was also having a single barrel gun. Upon being shot, the informant's father fell down and he was taken inside Shiv Kumar's house but as soon as he was taken inside the house, he died.10. PW 1 further stated that information of the incident was given to P.S. Kotwali Rath through the mobile telephone of Shiv Kumar. As a written information of an apprehended breach of peace due to the aforesaid dispute had already been given at the Police Station in the morning of the same day, Head Constable Chandra Bhan Singh (PW-3) and Constable Raj Singh reached the place of occurrence to carry out an enquiry on the aforesaid information within 5 - 7 minutes of the death of the informant's father. Afterwards, the Police went in search of the accused persons and the informant dictated a report of the incident which was scribed by Shiv Kumar.11. In his cross-examination, PW 1 stated that Ram Sewak was his Grand-father. Maheshwari was Ram Sewak's brother. Shiv Narayan and Shiv Kumar are sons of Maheshwari. Pradeep is son of Shiv Narayan. He also stated that the accused Shiv Narayan has a pucca double storied house opposite the residential house of the witness, which is used as the guest house of Shiv Narayan. There is a public passage between the two houses, which is about 5 feet wide and thereafter he said that the passage is 6 - 7 steps wide. He also stated that he did not see as to whether any blood fell at the place where his father had received the gun-shot. He had shown to the I.O. the place where his father was shot and where he fell down. The I.O. had taken samples of plain soil and blood stained soil from that place. Prior to the incident, his family members and the members of the family of Shiv Kumar used to visit each other's home but this had stopped since about 3 - 4 months before the incident, as the relations of his father and Shiv Narayan had turned bad and they and their family members were not at talking terms.12. PW 1 further stated in his cross examination that his father had come out of his house about half an hour before the incident, i.e., he had come out of the house at about 11:30 a.m. After having a light meal in the house, he came out and sat in the sun-light. He had got the report scribed by Shiv Kumar in the village and before scribing the report, at his instruction, Shiv Kumar had sent telephonic information of the incident to the Police Station. He had gone to the Police Station on the motor cycle of Surjan Singh and it took about 10 minutes to reach the Police Station. The I.O. and other Police persons had gone to the place of incident with the informant. The informant did not go with the I.O. inside the house of Shiv Narayan. The I.O. had entered Shiv Narayan's house accompanied by the constables and no villager had entered the house with him. The I.O. had brought an empty cartridge from Shiv Narayan's house.13. PW 1 was confronted with his affidavit dated 27-05-2005 (Exhibit B-1) in paragraph 6 whereof it was written that \"the procedure adopted by the Police in respect of empty cartridge was a step for providing benefit to the accused\" and he stated that he had signed it without reading and it was not"

Petitioners are old bona fide residents of Dewas, business\nmen and also income tax payees. Petitioner No.1 is father and\nthe petitioner No.2 is son.It appears that the respondent No.2, an advocate and also\nstyling himself as President of District Bar Association, Dewas\nhas had inimical attitude and grudge towards the petitioners and\ntheir family members. In the year 2013, the respondent No.2 had\nobjected to the application of the petitioners for establishment of\npetrol pump. The application met dismissal upto the appellate\nauthority. However, with the intervention of the Sate Government\nvide order dated 21/09/2015 in revisional jurisdiction wherein the2                  Mis. Cr. Case No.42429/2018Collector, Dewas was directed to grant licence to the wife of the\npetitioner No.2 and, accordingly, the petrol pump in the name and\nstyle of M/s Maa Kailadevi Motors has been opened and situated\non the land comprising of survey Nos.640, 645, 641 and 642\nPatwari Halka No.18, Indore Dewas Road, Dewas; total area\n1500 sq.ft., The licence is on record as Annexure P/9. The area\nof ownership and possession is 1500 sq.ft.,, out of which the\npetrol pump is situated covering an area of 800 sq.ft., and the\nremaining area is lying vacant. The District Court, Dewas is just\nadjacent to the petrol pump and the same is separated by barbed\nwire fencing installed by the petitioners.It is stated in the application that the advocate chambers of\nthe District Court, Dewas at the relevant point of time were under\nconstruction.    Building material was dumped on the main\nentrance gate of the District Court, therefore, heavy vehicles like\ntrucks and dumpers could not pass through the said gate. At the\nrequest of respondent No.2, petitioners temporarily permitted (for\none month) movement of vehicles carrying building material into\nthe District Court premises through the petitioners land by\nremoving the barbed wire fencing. The said movement appears\nto have continued for about three months. Since the movement of\nheavy vehicles into the Court premises through main gate\ncommenced, therefore, the temporary arrangement provided by\nthe petitioners was not required.            Hence, the petitioners\nreinstalled the barbed wire fencing on 12/10/2018.               No one\nobjected thereto. However, on 15/10/2018, around 12.00 noon,\nthe respondent No.2 allegedly trespassed into the land and\nwithout intimating the petitioners has removed the same with the\nhelp of some people. They have also removed cement poles\nsupporting the barbed wire fencing. The photograph is on record\nas Annexure P/10. While the petitioners resisted and objected to\nthe said uprooting of barbed wire fencing, the respondent No.2\nturned furious, manhandled petitioner No.2 with a threat to\nimplicate the petitioners under the provisions of the S.C., & S.T.,\nAct. Though the staff of the petrol pump tried to intervene but, all\nin vain.It is further stated that though they had submitted an\napplication before the respondent No.1 on 15/10/2018 narrating\nthe complete facts, however, no FIR was registered on the3                Mis. Cr. Case No.42429/2018compliant. The copy of complaint is on record as Annexure P/11.\nSimilar application was also filed by the Manager of the petrol\npump against the respondent No.2 for taking strict action. Copy of\nthe application is on record as Annexure P/12. Besides, manager\nof the petrol pump has also made an application before the\nDistrict Judge, Dewas and the District Collector, Dewas.            The\napplication is on record as Annexure P/13 but all in vain.However, to the utter surprise of the petitioners, instant FIR\nhas been registered at the instance of the respondent No.2.In the aforesaid backdrop of the factual matrix in hand, the\ninstant application undersection 482Cr.P.C., has been filed.3.    A reading of FIR suggests that on 15/10/2018 the\ncomplainant (respondent No.2) while he was sitting in the\npremises of the District Court at 01.30 pm., petitioners taking\nexception to the removal of barbed wire fencing alleged to have\nhurled filthy abuses and also by caste with a threat to kill\nbrandishing revolver towards him in front of about 50 advocates\nthough they were told that the fencing was initially installed inside\nthe District Court premises on the area allotted for construction of\nadvocate chambers. Accordingly, FIR has been registered.4.    This Court while hearing the matter on 07/12/2018, since\nwas of the view that the dispute between the parties is not of\nserious nature which should require a detailed investigation and\nessentially sparked off due to heated exchanges therefore, could\nbe sorted out through mediation, called upon petitioners and the\nrespondent No.2 to remain present before this Court on the next\ndate of hearing.On 10/12/2018, both petitioners and the respondent No.2\nwere present in person.Petitioners appeared and with folded hands submitted that\nthey are respectful citizens of the country and permanent old\nresidents of Dewas. They earn their livelihood through business.\nNeither do they believe in nor practice picking up fight with\npeople. They cannot even think of in their wildest dream to get\ninvolved in criminality against legal fraternity/advocates or cause\nany harm or hurt to any person. They have esteem regard and\nrespect to the Majesty of law. They shall abide by such orders or4                   Mis. Cr. Case No.42429/2018directions this Court deems fit and proper.Petitioners had shown grace with humbleness offering\napology in writing if the respondent No.2 or any member of the\nlegal fraternity either felt offended or hurt in the obtaining facts\nand circumstances.This Court records appreciation for the gesture shown by\npetitioners.Respondent No.2, though in the first breath agreed for\nresolution of the dispute or difference but, to dismay of this Court,\nturned around and followed the path of betrayal. It is unfortunate.\nIt is considered apposite to observe that the legal profession is a\nnoble profession.        Persons belonging to legal fraternity are\ninvolved in the process of justice dispensation and held in respect\nin the society. They stand out as class and are looked up for\nsocial, moral and ethical values in society.Alas! The respondent No.2 proved to be oblivious of such\nnoble values of the profession.Under the circumstances, this Court has finally heard the\nmatter.5.    While reiterating the law as regards the scope of\ninterference undersection 482Cr.P.C., in the matter of\nquashment of FIR, learned senior counsel placed reliance on the\njudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case ofState of\nHaryana Vs. Bhajan Lal and others, reported in AIR 1992 SC\n604; particularly; illustration (1) of para108 quoted below:\"108. In the backdrop of of the interpretation of various\n               relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and\n               of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a\n               series of decisions relating to the exercise of the\n               extraordinary power underArticle 226or the inherent\n               powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have\n               extracted and reproduced above, we give the following\n               categories of cases by way of illustrations wherein\n               such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse\n               of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the\n               ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay\n               down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently\n               channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae\n               and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases\n               wherein such power should be exercised.(1) Where the allegations made in the\n                      first information report or the complaint,\n                      even if they are taken at their face value\n                      and accepted in their entirety do not prima\n                      facie constitute any offence or make out a5                   Mis.

The appellant is before this Court in this appeal\n\n                         assailing the judgment dated 23.02.2017 passed by theSignature Not VerifiedHigh Court of Madhya Pradesh in Criminal AppealDigitally signed byDEEPAK SINGHDate: 2021.12.1716:06:10 ISTNo.691/2013 titled Ram Ratan vs. State of Madhya\nReason:1Pradesh. Though the said appeal was disposed of by the\n\nHigh Court along with the companion appeal, the\n\nconsideration herein is limited to the case against the\n\nappellant herein i.e. Ram Ratan who was arrayed as the\n\nfirst accused before the trial court.2.    The appeal before the High Court was filed by the\n\nappellant,   being   aggrieved     by   the   judgment   dated\n\n31.07.2013 passed by the Special Judge (MPDVPK Act)\n\n1981, Sheopur in Special Case No.13/2013 (old case\n\nNo.26/2012). Through the said judgment, the trial court\n\nhas convicted the appellant along with the other two\n\naccused namely, Chotu and Raju alias Rajendra underSection 392and397of Indian Penal Code (“IPC” for\n\nshort) read withSection 11/13of Madhya Pradesh\n\nDakaiti Aur Vyapharan Pravbhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam\n\n1981 Act (“MPDVPK Act, 1981” for short) and sentenced\n\nthe   appellant      and       other    accused   to   rigorous\n\nimprisonment of 7 years with fine of Rs.1000/­, in default\n\nof the same, to undergo imprisonment for a further2period of 4 months. The co­accused Raju alias Rajendra\n\nwas further convicted and sentenced under Section 25 (1­\n\nB) (a) ofArms Actto one­year rigorous imprisonment with\n\nfine of Rs.500/­, in default of the same, to further\n\nundergo 2 months rigorous imprisonment. Though all the\n\nthree accused had filed the respective appeals before the\n\nHigh Court against the said conviction and sentence, the\n\nco­accused Chotu died during the pendency of his\n\nappeal, due to which the said appeal abated. As noted\n\nabove, though the appeal of Raju alias Rajendra was also\n\nconsidered by the High Court through the common\n\njudgment, the present appeal is filed by the appellant\n\nalone and as such the conviction and sentence of the\n\nappellant based on the contentions put­forth on his\n\nbehalf only are adverted to in this judgment.3.    The brief facts are that one, Rajesh Meena lodged a\n\ncomplaint on 27.06.2012, alleging that on the intervening\n\nnight of 26­27/6/2012, while he was sleeping in the hut\n\nconstructed in the field to guard the crops, at about302:30 a.m, the appellant along with Raju alias Rajendra\n\nand Chotu came to him and woke him up. The said Raju\n\nalias Rajendra was having a gun with him and on\n\npointing the same towards the chest of the complainant,\n\ndemanded to part with the money. The complainant\n\ninformed that he did not have any money, due to which\n\nthe key of his motorcycle was snatched and the said Raju\n\nalias Rajendra also took out the mobile phone from the\n\npocket of his shirt. Thereafter, all the three accused\n\npersons forced the complainant to sit on the motorcycle\n\nalong with them. When they reached the village Nanawat,\n\nthe motorcycle got punctured and therefore all the\n\npersons compelled the complainant to get down from the\n\nmotorcycle and the motorcycle was taken away. By the\n\nsaid time since it was dawn, his uncle named Tulsiram\n\nwas passing by to milk the buffaloes. The complainant\n\nnarrated the incident, following which, steps were taken\n\nto lodge the complaint. The police having taken action,\n\nrecovered the motorcycle as also the mobile phone and4apprehended the accused. The police on completing the\n\ninvestigation filed the chargesheet against the appellant\n\nfor the offences underSections 392/397of IPC and\n\nunderSections 11/13of MPDVPK Act, 1981.4.    The trial court framed charges through the order\n\ndated 26.02.2013 underSections 392/397of IPC andSections 11/13of MPDVPK Act, 1981 against the\n\nappellant and Chotu, while an additional charge under\n\nSection 25 (1­B) (a)/27 of theArms Actwas framed\n\nagainst   the   other   co­accused    namely,    Raju   alias\n\nRajendra. The appellant and his co­accused having\n\npleaded not guilty, stood trial in the matter.5.    The trial court having noted the evidence tendered\n\nthrough PW1 to PW12, the documents which were\n\nmarked and the material objects identified, arrived at its\n\nultimate conclusion. While doing so, the trial court has\n\nreferred in detail to the evidence tendered by the\n\ncomplainant Rajesh (PW1) who narrated the entire\n\nincident from the time he was woken up in the midnight5and stated about having identified the accused as there\n\nwas a light burning in the hut. Tulsiram (PW2), uncle of\n\nthe complainant and Mukesh (PW3), brother of the\n\ncomplainant corroborated the version stated by the\n\ncomplainant. Dhanpal (PW5), father of the complainant\n\nhad also stated with regard to the sequence in which he\n\nhad come to know about the incident in the same\n\nsequence as had been stated by PW3. Mahavir (PW4),\n\nRamjilal (PW6) and Dhanjeet (PW7) are the witnesses to\n\nthe seizure of motorcycle and the gun respectively.\n\nHowever,    PW6     and       PW7   had   turned   hostile.\n\nChandrabhan Singh (PW8) is the witness who examined\n\nthe 12­bore gun. A.L. Azad (PW11) is the police officer\n\nwho arrested the accused and the other witnesses are the\n\nprocedural official witnesses.6.    The trial court on analysing the said evidence\n\nreturned the finding that the appellant and his co­\n\naccused had indulged in the incident complained of and\n\ntherefore held the charge to be proved. The conviction6and the sentence were accordingly handed down. The\n\nappellant   and   his   co­accused      while   assailing   the\n\njudgment of the trial court, apart from contending that\n\nthe case has been falsely alleged against them, had also\n\ncontended that the charge underSection 397of IPC\n\ncannot be sustained. It was their case that the firearm\n\neven if was proved to be carried, had not been used and\n\nas such the charge underSection 397IPC would not lie.\n\nThe High Court having adverted to the matter in detail\n\nhas reappreciated the evidence with regard to the\n\nincident and accordingly upheld the judgment passed by\n\nthe trial court convicting the appellant and sentencing\n\nhim in the manner as has been done. The appellant\n\ntherefore claiming to be aggrieved by the judgment\n\npassed by the trial court and upheld by the High Court,\n\nis assailing the same in this appeal.7.    Heard Mr. Shishir Kumar Saxena, learned counsel\n\nfor the appellant, Mr. Sunny Choudhary, learned counsel\n\nfor the respondent and perused the appeal papers.78.    The   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   while\n\nassailing the judgments would at the outset contend that\n\nthe complaint lodged by PW1 and the evidence tendered\n\nby him are not sufficient to indicate that the appellant is\n\nguilty of the charge alleged against him. It is contended\n\nthat the appellant has been implicated due to political\n\nrivalry, though no such incident as alleged had taken\n\nplace. In addition to the judgments cited before the High\n\nCourt and the contentions put­forth therein, learned\n\ncounsel has also relied on the decision of this Court\n\ndated 29.10.2021 in Crl. Appeal No.903 of 2021 titledGanesan vs. State Rep. by Station House Officerand\n\nconnected appeal i.e Crl. Appeal No.904 of 2021. With\n\nreference tothe said judgment, it is contended that\n\nfirstly, the charge underSection 397of the IPC would not\n\nbe sustainable since the gun has not been used and the\n\nconviction can be sustained only if the ‘offender’ uses any\n\ndeadly weapon while committing robbery. It is contended\n\nthat even otherwise, the charge underSection 397IPC8would not be sustainable against the appellant herein\n\nsince there is no serious allegation or proof of the\n\nappellant having used any weapon much less deadly\n\nweapon even if the incident of robbery which occurred is\n\nheld to be proved against the appellant. In that view, it is\n\ncontended that the appellant is liable to be acquitted or\n\nin the alternative, even if it is held that the charge underSection 392IPC is proved, the appellant has undergone\n\nsentence   of   nearly   4    years   which   is   sufficient\n\npunishment, which aspect be considered by this Court.9.     The learned counsel for the State would refer to\n\nthe evidence tendered before the trial court in detail and\n\nhas pointed out that the trial court as also the High\n\nCourt has taken note of the said evidence. The charge\n\nhaving been proved, both the Courts have arrived at the\n\nconclusion that the contention as put­forth by the\n\nappellant or his co­accused was not acceptable. It is\n\ncontended that the motorcycle and the mobile phone\n\nwhich had been stolen by the accused had been9recovered and the gun which was used was also seized\n\nand examined by the expert. In that circumstance, it is\n\ncontended that when the expert has opined that the gun\n\nwas in working condition, the actual use of the firearm by\n\nfiring from it is not required but the exposure of the\n\nweapon so as to create fear in the mind of the victim is\n\nsufficient to prove the charge underSection 397IPC. It\n\nis, therefore, contended that the judgment passed by the\n\ntrial court and confirmed by the High Court does not call\n\nfor i"

Certain witnesses made statements in a preliminary enquiry into a murder case before a Magistrate and contradicted these statements at the trial before the Sessions Court of South Arcot. The Sessions Court then sanctioned their prosecution for offences punishable underSection 193, Indian Penal Code, in that they had made contradictory statements, both on oath, one or other of which must necessarily be false. They were accordingly convicted by the Deputy Magistrate of an offence punishable under that section for having given false evidence by making statements, one or other of which must have been false. The Deputy Magistrate took no evidence to show which of the two statements was false and recorded no finding on that point. The accused appealed to the Sessions Court of South Arcot, and their appeals were transferred to the Sessions Judge of Chingleput who on hearing the appeals, came to the conclusion that the statements made by the appellant at the preliminary enquiry were probably false, and as the case was one of murder, he held that the offence committed by the appellants was probably, one punishable underSection 194, Indian Penal Code, and was therefore triable exclusively by the Court of Session and not by a Magistrate of the first-class, He held that as the facts indicated an offence underSection 194, Indian Penal Code, the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to try the appellants for an offence punishable underSection 193, Indian Penal Code. He accordingly set aside the conviction under that section. In one case (Appeal No. 20) he did not direct any further proceedings, as he considered the imprisonment already undergone sufficient punishment. In the other case-(Appeal No. 21) he ordered the appellant to be committed for trial by the Sessions Court on a charge underSection 194, Indian Penal Code. On a perusal of the calendars, this Court called for the records with a view to revise the orders of the Sessions Judge, and in sending up the records the learned Sessions Judge has submitted a note, setting forth in much detail his view of the law and arguments in support thereof.2. When he wrote this note we presume the learned Sessions Judge had received the judgment of this Court in King-Emperor v. Virasami Goundan Criminal Revision Case No. 78 of 1901 (unreported) in which, dealing with a precisely similar case from his Court a divisional bench of this Court held that the Sessions Judge had taken an incorrect view of the law. The accused was not charged with an offence punishable underSection 195, Indian Penal Code. The Deputy Magistrate tried him for an offence punishable underSection 193, Indian Penal Code, and he 'had jurisdiction over that offence. Under the rulings of this Court, it cannot be said that the Deputy Magistrate acted without jurisdiction, even though the offence actually amounted to one punishable underSection 195. We think that the learned Sessions Judge might well have accepted that decision. As, however, he still thinks that the decisions of this Court support his view it seems necessary to briefly reiterate the correct view of the law. The Sessions Judge relies onSection 530 (p)of the Criminal Procedure Code. It runs: \"If any Magistrate not being empowered by law '\"in this behalf .... tries an offender his proceedings shall \"be void.\" The meaning of this is that if a Magistrate tries an offender for an offence beyond his jurisdiction his proceedings shall be void. In the present case the Deputy Magistrate did not try accused for an offence beyond his jurisdiction. He tried him for an offence punishable underSection 193, Indian Penal Code, i.e., for an offence triable by a First class Magistrate and therefore within his jurisdiction. His proceedings therefore were not void and the Sessions Judge was wrong in treating them as void. Where the facts disclose an offence within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate it seems to us a complete fallacy to say he is not empowered by law to try the person charged for the offence which is within his jurisdiction, because the same facts disclose more serious offence which is beyond his jurisdiction. He is expressly so empowered. Whether in so doing he adopts a proper course is another question. No doubt it is improper on the part of a Magistrate to intentionally ignore circumstances of aggravation which show that an offence beyond his jurisdiction was in fact committed as well as an offence within his jurisdiction, as, for instance, if a Second class Magistrate should ignore the violence used in committing theft and should deal with the case himself as one of theft (Section 379), instead of sending the accused before a First class Magistrate to be tried for robbery (Section 392). Here the action of the Second-class Magistrate would be improper but his proceedings would not be void. If the improper action of the Second class Magistrate had led to a failure of justice us, for instance, by causing the punishment to be inadequate, it would be open to the proper authorities to apply a remedy by instituting a second prosecution on the same facts for the more aggravated offence (Section 403, Criminal Procedure Code). It would also, in our opinion, be open to the revising and appellate authorities to set aside the Magistrate's proceedings and order a fresh trial, if such a course was required in the interests of justice but not otherwise; and the reason for setting them aside would be, not that they were void ab initio, but because they were improper and the interests of justice required them to be set aside. The Sessions Judge has failed to appreciate the difference between proceedings which are without jurisdiction and therefore void, and proceedings which are improper and therefore liable to be set aside, though not void. It is this failure which we think, has led the Sessions Judge to misunderstand the various judgments of this Court to which he refer?. Whether the High Court as a Court of Revision or the Appellate Court ought to interfere in any particular case depends entirely on the facts of the case and whether such interference is called for in the interests of justice.3. The view that we have stated is, we think, in accordance with that taken by the Bombay High Court inQueen-Empress v. Gundya I.L.R.13 Bom. 502 as to the construction ofSection 530 (p), Criminal Procedure Code, and with the whole tenor of the decisions of this Court both before and since that provision of the Code was enacted in 1882. For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the cases quoted by the Sessions Judge from Weir's 'Law of Offences,' 3rd edition, at pages 259, 701, 965, 967, and 1060. If the learned Sessions Judge-will re-read these cases and bear in mind the distinction which we have pointed out between proceedings which are without jurisdiction and therefore void, and proceedings which are improper and therefore liable to be set aside though not void, he will, we think find that they lend no countenance to his views as to the proper construction to be placed on Section 530 (p) but are in accordance with the law as stated by us. The language of these cases is so explicit that it is unnecessary to refer to them in detail. The learned Sessions Judge has, however, so completely misunderstood and (no doubt unintentionally) misquoted the case at page 258 that it is necessary to refer briefly to it. In that case a First-class Magistrate had tried and convicted two offenders for offences punishable underSection 392, Indian Penal Code.. The Sessions Judge referred the cases on the ground that the offences were punishable respectively underSections 394and397, Indian Penal Code, and that the Magistrate therefore had no jurisdiction to try the offenders for an offence punishable underSection 392. The High Court pointed out that under the law then in force the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to try an offence underSection 394, and the High Court went on to observe that it was for the Magistrate, in his discretion, to decide whether be would dispose of the case himself (i.e., as one underSection 392) or commit the accused to the Court of Session (i.e., as one underSection 394). It further observed that as the case was of a trivial nature \"the Magistrate exercised a sound discretion in disposing of it underSection 392.\" It would be difficult to imagine a decision more directly opposed to the present Sessions Judge's view. We observe, however, that he supposed that an offence underSection 394was then, as it is now, triable either by the First-class Magistrate or by a Court of Sessions and this has no doubt, misled him. TheCriminal Procedure Codeof 1861 was then in force and under it an offence underSection 394, Indian Penal Code, was triable exclusively by a Court of Session, as indicated by the High Court in its judgment. It was not until theCriminal Procedure Codeof 1872 was passed that an offence underSection 394became triable by a First-class Magistrate or a Court of Session.4. In the second of the two cases dealt with by the High Court the accused had committed an offence punishable underSection 397, Indian Penal Code (robbery armed with a deadly weapon). The Magistrate tried him for an offence underSection 392and convicted him. The High Court set aside the conviction and ordered a. commitment to the Court of Session, not, as the present Sessions Judge supposes, because an offence underSection 397is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, but because an offence under that section must be punished with a minimum of seven years rigorous imprisonment, and it was therefore impossible for a Magistrate, whose powers are li"
