As all the captioned applications underSection 389of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for suspension of the\nsubstantive order of sentence of life imprisonment arise from a\nself-same judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed\nby the trial court, those were heard analogously and are being\ndisposed of by this common order.2.

We take notice of the fact that two cross-cases were tried\ntogether and both the sessions cases came to be disposed of by\na common judgment and order. The six applicants herein\nseeking suspension of the substantive order of sentence are\noriginal accused nos.2, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 respectively of the\nSessions Case No.152 of 2011. All the six applicants herein have\nbeen convicted for the offence punishable underSection 302IPC\nsimpliciter by determining their individual liability and have\nbeen sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. The trial court\ndisbelieved the case put up by the prosecution of unlawful\nassembly and common object. Accordingly, all the accused\npersons of both the cases came to be acquitted of the offences\npunishable underSections 147,148,149,427, 504, 506(2) andPage 2 of 86R/CR.A/1314/2018                               JUDGEMENT\n\n\n\n120B of theIndian Penal Code. The State has preferred the\nCriminal Appeal No.1077 of 2018 against the judgment and\norder of acquittal passed by the trial court in so far as the\nSessions Case No.152 of 2011 is concerned. The State has\nthought fit to file acquittal appeal so far as the acquittal of the\naccused persons of the offences punishable underSections 147,148,149,427,504,506(2)and120Bof the Indian Penal Code is\nconcerned.4.    It is the case of the prosecution that on the date of the\nincident, i.e. on 26th April 2011 at about 6:15 in the evening, 24\naccused persons armed with deadly weapons like sword, stick,\nsickle,   etc.    formed        an   unlawful        assembly   and     laid   an\nindiscriminate assault on the prosecution witnesses. In the said\nassault, one Babukhan Yusufkhan Pathan sustained severe\nhead injuries and succumbed.5.    To give a fair idea as regards the case put up by the\nprosecution, we may reproduce some portion of the evidence of\none of the eye-witnesses to the incident. The prosecution\nexamined PW3 Rahenakhatun Aslamkhan Pathan (Exh.135).\nShe is one of the injured eye-witnesses. In her evidence, she has\ndeposed as under :\"(1)   Afzalkhan happens to be my real brother.

Thereafter, my brother had made an application\nto the Taluka Development Officer, Mangrol, to disqualify\nAshif Maiyuddin as he was having three children. As per\nthe Government resolution, Ashif Maiyuddin was liable to\nbe disqualified, therefore, he was dismissed from the post\nof Deputy Sarpanch. Since then, they have been quarreling\nwith my brother and his family members on trivial matters.\nMy sister-in-law ('bhabhi') Rasimakhatun Afzalkhan Pathan\nwas a candidate from the BJP party from Kosamba seat\nand she had also won in the election.
