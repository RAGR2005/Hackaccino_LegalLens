It is stated that one, Jayanand, Sub-Inspector, had\n\nlodged a complaint with the Yelehanka         New Town Police\n\nStation, as on 2.6.2016, to the effect that the petitioner in Crl.P\n\n5075/2016, who was an erstwhile police constable dismissed\n\nfrom service, and who had formed an association called 'Akhila\n\nKarnataka Police Mahasangha' , was said to be spearheading a\n\nmovement to instigate the lower rung of the police force to act\n\nagainst the present elected government. That he along with the\n\nfirst of the petitioners in the second of these petitions, Crl.P\n\n5095/2016, and certain other persons, including the second of\n\nthe petitioners in the said petition, were conspiring to instigate\n\nthe police force to bring hatred and disaffection against the\n\nState Government amongst the general public, with an aim to\n\ndestabilize and bring down the present government.It was said to have been claimed that the petitioners had\n\nmade public speeches, and used the electronic social media\n\nsuch as, Facebook, Whatsapp and so on, to create hatred and\n\nexcite disaffection against the State Government, among the5police force and the public at large. The Petitioner in the first\n\nof these petitions, Shashidhar, is said to have a Facebook\n\nAccount, on which he had posted provocative photographs with\n\ncaptions like ' Sippayee Dungay'. He is said to have addressed\n\nmessages to the rank and file of the Karnataka Police force to\n\ngo on a mass leave on 4.6.2016, through out Karnataka State\n\nand to join hands in their war against the Government and the\n\nPolice Department.It transpires that the State Government, in order to avoid\n\nan unwelcome situation, is said to have issued a notification\n\ndated 31.5.2016, declaring that the Karnataka State Police\n\nForce as an essential service under theKarnataka Essential\n\nServices Maintenance Act, 2013. However, it is claimed that\n\nthis did not deter the petitioners from continuing with their\n\nonslaught through the various media to instigate and incite the\n\nmembers of the Police force not to buckle.It is pursuant to such complaint that the respondent -\n\nPolice are said to have registered an First Information Report6in Crime no.160/2016, for offences punishable underSections\n\n166,109,120B,124-Aof the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n\n(Hereinafter referred to as the 'IPC', for brevity),Section 5of\n\nthe Essential Services Management Act, 1981,Section 4of the\n\nPolice (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1966 andSection 4of\n\nthe Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966.The petitioners' applications for bail before the court\n\nbelow have been dismissed.It is the case of the petitioners that they are clueless as to\n\nwhy they have been apprehended and taken into custody. And\n\nhence the present petitions.3. Shri Ashok Harnahalli, Senior Advocate, appearing for\n\nthe counsel for the petitioner in Crl.P 5075/2016, would\n\ncontend that in order to attractSection 124-Aof the IPC, there\n\nmust be an intention to create disorder or to incite people to\n\nviolence either by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by\n\nvisible representation, or otherwise brings or attempts to bring7into hatred or contempt, or attempts to excite disaffection\n\ntowards the government established by law. It is pointed out\n\nthat the complaint does not indicate that the petitioners had\n\nincited people in order to create hatred against the government.It is contended that in order to invokeSection 109IPC, it\n\nmust be demonstrated that there was an offence committed as a\n\nconsequence of abetment or was committed as a consequence\n\nof instigation or in pursuance of a conspiracy or had aided the\n\ncommission of the offence - to constitute abetment. There is no\n\nevidence of any of the ingredients to constitute the offence of\n\nabetment.It is contended that the provisions of theEssential\n\nServices Maintenance Act, 1981, thePolice (Incitement to\n\nDisaffection) Act, 1981and thePolice Forces (Restriction of\n\nRights) Act, 1966are only applicable to persons who are\n\nmembers of the force of the State.       As the same are not\n\napplicable to the petitioners, it is inexplicable that the8petitioners are taken into custody for the alleged commission of\n\noffences under the said Statutes.Similarly,Section 166IPC, would apply to a person\n\nbeing a public servant, in that, where a public servant\n\nknowingly disobeys any direction of the law with an intention\n\nto cause injury to any person, thenSection 166IPC would\n\napply. Even according to the complaint, the petitioners are not\n\nserving members of the Police force. Hence, the case against\n\nthe petitioners is not maintainable.4. Per contra, the learned Additional Advocate General,\n\nShri A.S.Ponnanna, vehemently opposes the petition and\n\ncontends that the arrest and confinement of the accused,\n\nparticularly accused no.1, was found to be imperative to avoid\n\nan impending disaster - for if the said accused had succeeded in\n\ncalling for a state-wide protest by the Police force, by resorting\n\nto mass leave and protests by rallies, even for a day, it would\n\nhave lead to a complete breakdown of law and order through9out the State, which may have even lead to the further\n\nconsequence of the present government itself being destabilized- to the advantage of rival political parties.It is emphasized by Shri Ponnanna, that a plain perusal of\n\nthe content of the public speeches made by accused no.1, the\n\nmessages and posts on the electronic social media,        would\n\nclearly demonstrate the virulent campaign embarked upon by\n\nthe accused to create hatred and disaffection against the State\n\nGovernment, among the Police force and the public in general.\n\nIf not for the timely action by the State Government in invoking\n\ntheKarnataka Essential Services Maintenance Act, 2013, in\n\npreventing any such precipitative action that was planned for\n\n4.6.2016, the consequences of the petitioner's inflammatory and\n\nprovocative speeches and messages would have been\n\ndisastrous.It is contended that as is evident from the contents of the\n\npetitions and the arguments canvassed on behalf of the\n\npetitioners, even now it is claimed that the actions of the10petitioners are justifiable and that the same cannot be curbed.\n\nIn which event, if the petitioners are enlarged on bail - there is\n\ncertain to be a repetition of their anti-government activities\n\nthereby escalating the hatred and disaffection sought to be\n\ncreated against the State governme"

No.286/2008, 288/2008, 289/2008, 298/2008 and\n299/2008 respectively, for the offences punishable undersections\n120-B,124Aand34of the Indian Penal Code as well assection 3of\nthe Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1922.2.\t\tThe\nfacts of the case are that the respondent No.2 - first\ninformant was appointed as Police Commissioner, Ahmedabad city on\n20th\nMay, 2008. The Times of India published certain news items in its\nAhmedabad edition beginning from 27th\nMay, 2008. The first news item came to be published under the heading\n\"Was Ahmedabad CP a Latif Man?  CBI papers cast a shadow on\nO.P. Mathur's role in Ex-MP Rauf Valiullah's murder in 1992\".3.\t\tOn\n28th\nMay, 2008, the Ahmedabad edition of Times of India carried a news\nitem titled \"How can Ahmedabad be safe in his hands?  As Head\nof 'Latif Squad', was Mathur also on don's payroll?\". It also\ncarried a news item that before becoming Commissioner of Police,\nAhmedabad, the respondent No.2 was serving as D.G.P., CID (Crime) and\nJails and the day before he left the charge of jails, the City Crime\nBranch raided the Sabarmati jail on a tip-off from Central\nIntelligence Bureau that a terrorist network was planning a major\njail-break to allow some hard-core terrorists to escape. The news\nreport also stated that IB intercepts of international calls made out\nof Ahmedabad had people across the border speaking to each other\nabout a jail-break in Sabarmati. The news item also revealed that\nthree SIM cards and two mobiles were found from the jail and despite\njammers installed in high security prison, the record showed that\nterrorists were making calls freely to Pakistan. It was pointed out\nthat the jail-break plans were scuttled not on account of any\nalertness on the part of the jail establishment under Mathur but\nbecause of timely intercepts by the IB and quick follow up action\ntaken by the Crime Branch headed by Joint Police Commissioner,\nAhmedabad Shri Ashish Bhatia who confirmed to Times of India that\ninternational calls were made from the phones and SIM cards seized by\nthe police.4.\t\tOn\n29th\nMay, 2008, the Times of India, Ahmedabad edition published a news\nitem showing that at the instance of the High Court of Gujarat, an\noffence was registered against respondent No.2 - Shri Mathur\nfor attempt to murder and sexual harassment and issuing threats to a\nwoman lawyer Sarita Sharma and that he brandished a revolver and left\nit at his lady love's house. The news item had appeared under the\ntitle \"OPM high A'bad can do without - He brandished\nrevolver, left it at lady love's house\".  Another news item was\ntitled \"Geetha showed who is boss\" and refers to DCP\nGeetha Johri promptly acting upon a tip-off that Latif and his gang\nhad been spotted at Mahad Ka Mohalla and while Latif escaped two of\nhis men were arrested by Geetha and her men and that by the time\nMathur dragged his feet to reach Mahad Ka Mohalla, things had\nquietened down.  Geetha was already on her way to Shahibaug with her\ntwo prize catches. The said edition also contained a column bearing\nthe heading \"Do you want O P Mathur to continue as commissioner\nof police, Ahmedabad? and\ninvited opinions of the readers.5.\t\tOn\n30th\nMay, 2008, the Times of India contained a news item bearing the\nheading \"Crooked path to the crown\" \"OP Mathur Got\nthe Position of Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad, as Reward For\nBotching Up The Probe Into The Fake Encounter of Sohrabuddin, A Close\nAssociate of Mafia Don Latif\". It was reported therein that an\nimportant CD which contains the details of telephone calls made by\npolice officers, businessmen and politicians which indicated a\npossible nexus behind the elimination of Sohrabuddin in order to save\nsome Rajasthan based businessmen from his extortion threats was found\nmissing after it was handed over to Mathur by Rajnish Rai. The news\nitem also indicated that if the CD was still a part of Sohrabuddin\ncase papers then probably a top Gujarat minister and a high ranking\nBJP politician of Rajasthan would be running for cover and this\npolitical duo reciprocated last week by making Mathur the\nCommissioner of Police. This edition also invited viewers' opinion as\nin the preceding edition.6.\t\tOn\n31st\nMay, 2008, the Ahmedabad edition of Times of India carried a news\nitem under the heading \"Latif an ISI man and Mathur a Latif\nman? - Five million Amdavadis can't be safe under new police chief\nwith dubious links\".  It also carried a news item that one\nJatin Desai, who had a scuffle with Shri Mathur for which the High\nCourt of Gujarat had directed registration of first information\nreport against Shri Mathur refused to meet Mathur for revolver\nlicence and requested that he should be allowed to represent his case\nbefore a higher authority. The newspaper also carried news item\npointing out that in response to the news items carried by Times of\nIndia, 98% of the readers\ndid not want Mathur to continue as Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad.7.\t\tOn\n1st\nJune, 2008, the Ahmedabd edition of Times of India carried three news\nitems regarding the underworld late Abdul Wahab Latif and his close\nassociates Sharif Khan and Rauf Valiullah, Ex-M.P.8.\t\tIn\nthe aforesaid background, the respondent No.2 - Shri Mathur lodged\nthe above referred first information reports.9.\t\tPursuant\nto the lodging of the above referred first information reports, the\napplicants filed Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.6960/2008.\nHowever, the said case was not argued on merits and came to be\nwithdrawn with liberty to file a fresh application for quashing\nincluding the grounds raised in the said application, since the\napplicants wanted to make representation before the State Government.\n Subsequently, after withdrawal of the said application, the\napplicants moved a representation to the State Government vide letter\ndated 6th\nJune, 2008. According to the applicants, the representation has not\nbeen decided despite the fact that almost ten days had passed and\nthat the investigating agency despite the pendency of the\nrepresentation had started summoning large number of persons from the\nTimes of India. According to the applicants, the entire purpose seems\nto be to ensure that the representation before the State Government\nbecomes infructuous. Under the circumstances, the applicants have\nmoved the present applications for quashing the above referred first\ninformation reports.10.\t\tMr.\nS.V. Raju, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants in\neach of the applications, invited attention to the relevant news\nitems in respect of which the offences in question are alleged to\nhave been committed to submit that none of the news items even\nremotely indicate, leave alone, cause hatred against the Government.\nReferring to the allegations made in the first information report it\nwas submitted that it appears that the respondent No.2 is annoyed\nthat the news items have appeared against him and except for using\nthe words that the new items have been published only with a view to\ncause contempt and hatred against Senior Police Officers and the\nState Government, nothing has been stated which would constitute an\noffence punishable undersection 124AIPC.10.1\t\t\tAttention\nwas invited to the provisions of Chapter VI of theIndian Penal Codewhich relates to offences against the State to submit that section\n124A is categorised as an offence against the State. It was submitted\nthat though essentially all offences are against the State, offences\nfalling under Chapter VI of theIndian Penal Codeare of a nature\nwhich require the first information report to be lodged only by the\nState inasmuch as it is an offence specifically committed against the\nState in particular. It was, accordingly, argued that an offence\nunder section 124A is an offence against the State, however, the\nState is not an a"
