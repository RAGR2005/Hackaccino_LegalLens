Thakker,D.K. JainCASE NO.:\nAppeal (crl.)  855 of 2007\n\nPETITIONER:\nRAJ KUMAR @ RAJU\n\nRESPONDENT:\nSTATE OF UTTARANCHAL\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 07/04/2008\n\nBENCH:\nC.K. THAKKER & D.K. JAIN\n\nJUDGMENT:J U D G M E N T\nREPORTABLE\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 855 OF 2007\n\nC.K. THAKKER, J.1.\t\tThis appeal is filed by Raj Kumar @ \nRaju-accused No.1 in Sessions Trial No. 14 of \n1983. He was convicted for an offence \npunishable underSection 396of the Indian \nPenal Code (IPC) along with three other accused \nand ordered to undergo rigorous imprisonment \nfor ten years and to pay fine of Rs.2,000, in \ndefault of payment of fine, to undergo \nadditional imprisonment for one year. The said \norder was passed by the II Addl. Sessions \nJudge, Nainital on August 9, 1985. The \nappellant preferred an appeal against the said \njudgment and order which was registered as \nCrimial Appeal No. 2128 of 1985 in the High \nCourt of Allahabad and was re-numbered as \nCriminal Appeal No. 315 of 2001 in the High \nCourt of Uttaranchal at Nainital and was \ndismissed by the High Court on December 16, \n2006.2.\t\tThe case of the prosecution was that \non September 24, 1982 one Tilak Raj-PW1 \nsubmitted a written report at Police Station, \nKhatima stating therein that when he reached \nhis house for taking lunch at about 12.30 p.m., \nhe saw Raj Kumar @ Raju, Pushpendra Singh, \nSwadesh Chandra @ Gappu and Nirankar in his \nhouse. All the accused were dragging his wife \nwho was soaked in blood. According to Tilak \nRaj, on seeing him, the accused fled away. \nThough he tried to catch hold of them, \nPushpendra Singh pushed at his chest due to \nwhich he fell down. He raised hue and cry. \nAccording to the complainant Raj Kumar, Swadesh \nChandra @ Gappu and Nirankar were holding \nknives. All the accused committed loot of \narticles from his house and also committed \nmurder of his wife Kamlesh Kumari. Rajendra \nKumar-PW6, Purshottam Lal-PW3, Prem Kumar-PW5 \nand other persons who came there, also saw the \naccused running away. The first information was \nrecorded and investigation was conducted. \nAccused were arrested and certain articles were \nalso recovered from them. On completion of \ninvestigation, charge-sheet was submitted by \nthe Investigating Officer against four accused \nreferred to above and two others, namely, Mohan \nLal and Balram Singh for offences punishable \nunderSections 396and412read withSection \n120B, IPC. The case was committed by the \nMagistrate to learned II Addl. Sessions Judge. \nCharge was framed and the accused were asked \nwhether they pleaded guilty upon which they \ndenied to have committed any offence and \nclaimed to be tried.3.\t\tIn order to prove the case against the \naccused, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses. \nOut of them Tilak Raj-PW1, informant and \nhusband of deceased Kamlesh Kumari was an eye-\nwitness who supported the case of the \nprosecution. According to him, he saw all the \naccused dragging dead body of his wife Kamlesh \nKumari from kitchen. He wanted to catch hold of \nthe accused but could not do so as Pushpendra \nSingh pushed him and resultantly he fell down. \nIt was also his case that on hearing his cries, \nPW3-Purshottam Lal, PW5-Prem Kumar and PW6-\nRajendra Kumar reached at the scene of offence \nand saw all the accused running away. After the \narrest of accused, looted property and weapons \nof offence, namely, knives were recovered.4.\t\tIt was also the case of the \nprosecution that there was a conspiracy to \ncommit dacoity by all the accused on the \nprevious day i.e. September 23, 1982. To prove \nconspiracy, the prosecution examined PW7-Kishan \nLal-real brother of PW1-Tilak Raj. PW11-Dr. \nJ.K. Goel who performed post-mortem of deceased \nKamlesh Kumari on September 25, 1982 was \nexamined to prove injuries sustained by the \ndeceased and to establish that she died due to \nthose injuries.5.\t\tThe case of the accused underSection \n313of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was \nof total denial. In support of their case, the \naccused examined DW1-Dr. Joshi and DW2-Laxmi \nDatt.6.\t\tThe trial Court, after appreciating \nthe evidence on record, held that it was not \nproved by the prosecution that there was \nconspiracy between the accused to commit \ndacoity. So far as charge for committing an \noffence punishable underSection 120B, IPC is \nconcerned, the trial Court acquitted them. \nLikewise, the trial Court held that since \nrecovery effected by the prosecution was not in \nconsonance with law, it could not be said that \nstolen articles of dacoity were found from the \naccused and consequently charge for an offence \npunishable underSection 412, IPC also could \nnot be said to be established. All the accused \nwere, therefore, acquitted.7.\t\tThe Court, however, held that as far \nas commission of an offence punishable underSection 396was concerned, from the evidence of \nPW1-Tilak Raj and PW3-Purshottam Lal, PW5-Prem \nKumar and PW6-Rajendra Kumar, it was clearly \nestablished. According to the Court, however, \nan offence punishable underSection 396, IPC \nwas established against accused Nos. 1 to 4 Raj \nKumar @ Raju-A1, Pushpendra Singh-A2, Swadesh \nChandra @ Gappu-A3 and Nirankar-A4. It was not \nestablished that Mohan Lal-A5 and Balram Singh-\nA6 were also present and party to the crime. \nThey were, therefore, ordered to be acquitted.8.\t\tAll the four convicted accused \npreferred appeal and the High Court, as stated \nabove, confirmed the order of conviction and \nsentence recorded by the trial Court and \ndismissed the appeal.9.\t\tNotice was issued by this Court in the \npresent appeal instituted by accused No.1-Raj \nKumar @ Raju on February 9, 2007. On July 9, \n2007, leave was granted. Bail, however, was \nrefused. In view of the said fact, the matter \nwas placed for final hearing and that is how \nthe matter is before us.10.\t\tWe have heard learned counsel for the \nparties.11.\t\tThe learned counsel for the appellant \ncontended that both the Courts have committed \nan error in convicting the appellant for an \noffence punishable underSection 396, IPC. It \nwas submitted that charge was framed for an \noffence punishable underSection 396, IPC \nagainst the appellant along with other five \naccused. When the trial Court acquitted two of \nthem, no conviction could have been recorded of \nthe remaining four accused for an offence \npunishable underSection 396, IPC. It was \nsubmitted that for conviction of accused underSection 396, IPC, there must be five or more \npersons and in view of acquittal of two out of \nsix persons, both the Courts were wrong in \ninvoking and applyingSection 396, IPC. On that \nground alone, the order of conviction and \nsentence deserves to be set aside. It was also \nsubmitted that all the accused were charged for \ncriminal conspiracy but they were acquitted for \nan offence punishable underSection 120B, IPC \nand the said order was not challenged by the \nState. Again, all the accused were charged for \nan offence of dishonestly receiving property \nstolen in the commission of dacoity, punishable \nunderSection 412, IPC, but even on that count, \nthe trial Court acquitted them and the said \norder also has attained finality. In the light \nof the above facts, conviction of the appellant \nunderSection 396, IPC is clearly illegal and \nrequires to be set aside. It was stated by the \nlearned counsel that the appellant was never \ncharged for commission of an offence of murder \nof deceased Kamlesh Kumari, punishable underSection 302, IPC and the Courts went wrong in \nconvicting him underSection 396, IPC. The \ncounsel submitted that the appeal deserves to \nbe allowed by setting aside the order of \nconviction and sentence recorded by the trial \nCourt and confirmed by the High Court.12.\t\tThe learned Government Pleader, on the \nother hand, supported the order of conviction \nand sentence by both the Courts. He submitted \nthat it is true that all the accused were \nacquitted by the trial Court for committing an \noffence punishable underSection 120B, IPC \n(criminal conspiracy). It is also true that \nthey were acquitted of an offence punishable \nunderSection 412, IPC (for dishonestly \nreceiving or retaining property stolen in \ncommission of dacoity). It is equally true that \nout of six accused, two were acquitted by the \ntrial Court by giving benefit of doubt and \nhence there were less then five accused before \nthe Court. But from the prosecution evidence \nand particularly from the evidence of PW1-Tilak \nRaj, PW3-Purshottam Lal, PW5-Prem Kumar and \nPW6-Rajendra Kumar, the Courts below were \nconvinced that there was dacoity in the house \nof PW1-Tialk Raj and during the course of \ncommitting dacoity, the accused killed Kamlesh \nKumari, wife of PW1-Tilak Raj and convicted the \nappellant underSection 396, IPC. That order \ncannot be said to be illegal or unlawful. \nAlternatively, the learned counsel contended \nthat the accused had committed murder of \nKamlesh Kumari and they can independently be \nconvicted for an offence punishable underSection 302, IPC simpliciter. He, therefore, \nsubmitted that the appeal deserves to be \ndismissed.13.\t\tHaving heard learned counsel for the \nparties, in our opinion, the appeal deserves to \nbe allowed. It is not in dispute that charges \nwere framed against six persons but even the \ntrial Court was not convinced with the \nprosecution evidence about complicity of all \nthe accused and granted benefit of doubt to two \nof them. It may be stated that the trial Court \ndid not record a finding that there were six \npersons who committed dacoity and out of them, \ntwo accused could not be identified but the \nremaining four were identified and came to the \nconclusion that it was proved that there were \nsix accused and all of them "

They were tried  and\theld  guilty\nLinders.  395of the Indian Penal Code.   The\t High  Court\ndismissed their appeals.  In appeal by special leave to this\nCourt their only contention was that in the absence of other\nevidence  connecting them with the dacoity, the\t presumption\nto  be drawn from the possession of stolen clothes ought  to\nhave been one under s. 411 of heIndian Penal Codeor at the\nmost  under  s.\t 412 of theIndian Penal  Codeand  not  of\ncomplicity in the crime of dacoity.  It was urged that sinces.  114of the Evidence Act did not lay down definitely\t the\npresumption  to be drawn in a given set of circumstances  it\nwas  necessary always to start with the\t lesser\t presumption\nand  draw  the higher presumption only when there  was\tsome\nother evidence to. show the complicity of the persons in the\ncrime itself.\n     HELD : If there is other evidence to connect an accused\nwith  the  crime itself, however small, the finding  of\t the\nstolen\tproperty  with\thim is a  piece\t of  evidence  which\nconnects  him  further\twith the crime.\t There\tis  then  no\nquestion of presumption.  The evidence strengthens the other\nevidence  already against him.\tIt is only when the  accused\ncannot\tbe  conis stronger than if there is a large  gap  of\ntime.

It was legitimate therefore to raise\t the\npresumption  in\t this case that the persons  with  whom\t the\ngoods were found were the dacoits themselves. [723 A-B]\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:CRIMINAL\tAPPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal\t No.\n87 of 1967.721Appeal  by\tspecial leave from the\tjudgment  and  order\ndated  January\t 24,  1967 of the High Court  of  Mysore  in\nCriminal Appeal .No. 29 of 1965.A. S. R. Chari and R. V. Pillai, for the appellants.\n    Shyamala Pappu and S. P. Nayar, for the respondent.\n    The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n    Hidayatullah, C.J. , These are 14 appellants who  appeal\nagainst\t their conviction unders. 395of the  Indian  Penal\nCode  and  sentences of 5 years' rigorous  imprisonment\t and\nfine  of Rs. 1,000/- passed on them.  Originally 20  persons\nwere tried and convicted for the same offence and received a\nlike  sentence. 14 alone have appealed to this\tCourt.\t The\nincident  which\t took place on July 28, 1962  was  theft  by\ndacoity\t of certain cotton pieces from two carts within\t the\nlimits of Lingsugar Police Station at about 11-30 p.m.\n    The facts are that two traders in cloth sent their wares\nin carts for sale.  The cartmen halted after the market\t was\nover  on  the way for food.  Thereafter six carts  left\t for\nMudgal at about 10 p.m. When the carts reached a Nala called\nHeri  Halla about three miles from Lingsugur at about  11-30\np.m.,  20 persons are said to have approached the carts\t and\npelted stones.\tIt was a dark night and the assailants\twere\nnot  identified.  It appears that four out of the six  carts\nescaped, but two carts were looted.  The police investigated\nthe case and arrested the 20 persons who were accused in the\ncase as being the culprits involved in this incident.\n    It\tis not necessary to go into rest of the case or\t the\nevidence  on  which  the case of  dacoity  was\testablished,\nbecause\t dacoity as such is not challenged before  us.\t The\naccused\t were  convicted on the sole evidence of  having  in\ntheir possession pieces of cloth which were later identified\nto belong to the -traders.  Searches took place between July\n30, 1962 and August 17, 1962.  In these searches cloth which\nwas undoubtedly stolen at the time of the dacoity was  found\nin  their houses.  The High Court, and the Court below\tdrew\nfrom this the conclusion that the appellants were themselves\nthe dacoits, and convicted them accordingly unders. 395of\nthe  Indian  Penal  Code and sentenced\tthem  to'  5  years'\nrigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 100/-.In this appeal, the only contention raised by Mr. A. S.\nR.  Chari  is that the presumption that\t they  were  dacoits\nought not to have been drawn since the circumstances do\t not\nadmit  the  drawing  of\t such a\t presumption  in  the  case,\nAccording to Mr. Chari, the presumption to be drawn ought to\nhave been one underS. 411722of  Indian  Penal Code or at the most tinders. 412of\t the\nIndian\tPenal  Code but not of complicity in  the  crime  of\ndacoity.  He contends that the circumstances under which the\none  presumption or the other may be drawn unders.  114of\nthe  Indian  Evidence Act have not been stated\tby  law\t and\ntherefore  it is necessary always to start with\t the  lesser\npresumption and draw the higher presumption only when  there\nis some other evidence to show the complicity of the persons\nin  the\t crime itself.\tAccording to him there is  no  other\nevidence in the case which points, to the complicity of\t the\n14 appellants in the crime of dacoity and therefore as\tthey\ncannot\tbe  suspected  to be dacoits  themselves,  the\tonly\npresumption  to\t be  drawn is one  of  receivers  of  stolen\nproperty  or as receivers of property which was stolen in  a\ndacoity.In\tour opinion, the law advocated by Mr. Chari  is\t not\ncorrect.  If there is other evidence, to connect an  accused\nwith  the  crime itself, however small, the finding  of\t the\nstolen\tproperty  with\thim is a  piece\t of  evidence  which\nconnects  him  further\twith the crime.\t There\tis  then  no\nquestion of presumption.  The evidence strengthens the other\nevidence  already against him.\tIt is only when the  accused\ncannot\tbe  connected  with the crime except  by  reason  of\npossession  of the fruits of crime that the presumption\t may\nbe drawn.  In what circumstances the one presumption or\t the\nother\tmay  be\t drawn,\t it  is\t not  necessary\t  to   state\ncategorically  in  this\t case.\t It  all  depends  upon\t the\ncircumstances  under  which the discovery of the  fruits  of\ncrime  are  made  with a particular accused.   It  has\tbeen\nstated on more than one occasion that if the gap of time is,\ntoo  large, the presumption that the accused  was  concerned\nwith  the  crime itself gets weakened.\tThe  presumption  is\nstronger  when the discovery of the fruits of crime is\tmade\nimmediately  after the crime is. committed.  The  reason  is\nobvious.   Disposal  of\t the fruits of\tcrime  requires\t the\nfinding of a person ready to receive them and the  shortness\nof  time, the nature of the property which is  disposed\t of,\nthat  is  to say, its quantity and its\tcharacter  determine\nwhether\t the  person  who had the goods\t in  his  possession\nreceived  them from another or was himself the thief or\t the\ndacoit.\t In some cases there may be other elements which may\npoint  to  the way as to how the presumption may  be  drawn.\nThey  need not be stated here for they differ from  case  to\ncase.(In  the  present case, the goods stolen were  a  large\nquantity  of  cloth  taken for sale to\tthe  market.   These\ngoods were not sold and were being taken back to the dealers\nby the cartmen.) A large number of persons said to be 20  in\nnumber\tpelted\tstones\tat  the\t cartmen  and  looted\tthe,\nproperty.  Immediately afterwards a number of searches\twere\nmade and the goods were found with various persons who\twere\nprosecuted  as offenders and they have been presumed  to  be\ninvolved in the dacoity itself.\t It may be723noticed that from each person a large number of goods of the\nsame  type  such as 20 choli pieces or ten pieces  of  cloth\nwere  found.  (It is, impossible to think  that\t within\t the\nshort  time  available, these goods could have\tbeen  easily\ndisposed  of  to receivers of stolen property  or  could  be\nplaced\tin  the\t custody of friends till such  time  as\t the"
