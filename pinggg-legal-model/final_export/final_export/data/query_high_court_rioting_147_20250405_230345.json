The\nTrial  Judge   acquitted  three\t  of  the  accused  persons,\nconvicted two underS. 302I.P.C. and one underS. 324.\n     Cross-appeals were\t preferred in the High Court; one by\nthe three  accused against their convictions, and another by\nthe State,  against the acquittals. The High Court convicted\nall the\t six accused  of the  offence of rioting. A-2 to A-6\nunderS.  302read  withS.  34, A-1  under Ss.\t 302/149 and\n302/109, and  A-2 underS. 324. It was contended before this\nCourt that  on the facts of the case, the High Court was not\njustified in  interfering with the acquittal of A-1. A-5 and\nA-6, and  that A-2 who did not physically participate in the\nfatal beating of the deceased, could not be held vicariously\nliable for  the acts  of others,  and thatS.\t34was\t not\napplicable to him.\n     Partly allowing the appeals, the Court\n^\n     HELD: (1)\tIn the case of an offence involving physical\nviolence, it  is essential for the application ofS. 34that\nthe person  who instigates  or aids  the commission  of\t the\ncrime must be physically present at the actual commission of\nthe crime  for the  purpose of facilitating or promoting the\noffence, the  commission of  which is  the aim\tof the joint\ncriminal venture. [881 C-D]\n     (2) The  \"act\" spoken  of inS. 34includes a series of\nacts as\t a single  act. It  follows that  the words  \"when a\ncriminal act  is done  by several  persons\" inS. 34, may be\nconstrued to  mean \"when  criminal acts\t are done by several\npersons\". The  acts committed  by different  confederates in\nthe criminal action may be different but all must in one way\nor  the\t  other\t participate  and  engage  in  the  criminal\nenterprise. Such  presence of  those who  in one  way or the\nother facilitate  the execution\t of the\t common\t design,  is\nitself tantamount  to actual  participation in the 'criminal\nact'. [881 A-B & D]\n     (3) The  essence ofS. 34is simultaneous consensus of\nthe minds  of persons participating in the 'criminal action'\nto bring  about a  particular result.  Such consensus can be\ndeveloped at  the spot\tand thereby intended by all of them.\n[881 D-E]\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:CRIMINAL APPELLATE\t JURISDICTION: Criminal\t Appeal\t No.\n251 of 1972 and 243 of 1973.Appeals by\t Special Leave\tfrom the  Judgment and order\ndated 22-9-72  of the  Madras High  Court in Criminal Appeal\nNo. 369/72 and 976/71.Debaratea\tMookerjee,   M.\t S.

Criminal Appeal  No. 251 of 1972 has been\nfiled under  section 2\tof the Supreme Court (Enlargement of\nCriminal Appellate  Jurisdiction)  Act,\t 1970  and  Criminal\nAppeal No. 243 of 1973 is by special leave. In all there are\nsix appellants. It would be convenient to refer to them with\nreference to  their accused  number given in the judgment of\nthe Sessions Court. They are as follows:Accused No. 1 (A-1)-Ramaswami Ayyangar.\n\t  Accused No. 2 (A-2)-Vattappan.Accused No. 3 (A-3)-Kaipillai alias Karuppayyan.\n\t  Accused No. 4 (A-4)-Raman.Accused No. 5 (A-5)-Kathayyan.Accused No. 6 (A-6)-Kulandaiyan.The occurrence  giving rise  to these  two appeals took\nplace on  Monday the  21st April, 1971 at about 4.00 p.m. at\nSivan Koil  tank in village Thaduthalkondapuram. In the said\noccurrence was\tseriously injured one Kaliaperumal who later\ndied in\t the Hospital  at about\t 9.00 p.m. the same evening.\nAnother person\tinjured in  the occurrence  was\t also  named\nKaliaperumal, P.W.  1. The prosecution case is that deceased\nKaliaperumal was  living  with\this  maternal  uncle  Pichai\nKonar, P.W.  7 since  infancy. A-1  is\tthe  Karnam  of\t the\nvillage and  A-6 is  the Government  vetti. A-2\t and A-3 are\nbrothers, A-4,\tA-5 and\t A-6 are also inter-se brothers. A-2\nto A-6 worked under A-1. There was enmity between P.W. 7 and\nthe deceased on the one hand and A-1 on the other on account\nof several causes. The facts showing the enmity between them\nare stated  in the judgments of the courts below and are not\nnecessary to  be  detailed  here.  Two\tdays  prior  to\t the\noccurrence Marimuthu,  P.W. 10 was driving some cattle, 4 or\n5 of  them went\t astray and  entered into  the\tGingillillai\n(field) belonging  to A-1. A-1's men scolded P.W. 10 and the\ndeceased who  was informed  about the incident by the former\nat a  tea shop.\t P.W. 1\t was also  present  there.  Deceased\nKaliaperumal passed on the information to P.W. 7.Ramalingam, P.W.  4 brother  of the deceased was taking\nhis bath  in the  Sivan Koil  tank. Kaliaperumal  (deceased)\nalso came there saying something against the Karnam. He also\nstarted bathing\t at the\t north-western corner  of the  tank.\nAccording to  the prosecution  case, A-1 came there followed\nby A-2\tto A-6.\t A-2 had a cross-stop (an instrument used in\nSurvey and  measurement, perhaps  the correct  name  of\t the\ninstrument is cross-staff). A-3 and A-4 were each armed with\nan Aruval. A-5 had a stick and A-6 was carrying a stick with\na spear\t attached to it. According to the evidence in Court,\nA-1 told  the other  accused \"Not  content to  with  grazing\n(his) cattle  in my  gingilly field,  he is also abusing me.\nCut him,  whatever be the expenses, I will look after that.\"\nThereupon A-4  asked the  deceased Kaliaperumal \"Why are you\nabusing the 'Iyer' ?\" Saying something Kaliaperumal ascended\nthe bank.  A-3 and  A-4\t assaulted  him\t on  his  head\twith\nAruvals. P.W.  1 ran to separate them when A-2 assaulted him\non878his head  with the  cross-stop. P.W.  1\t attempted  to\trun.\nThereupon it  is said  A-6 obstructed  him from running with\nthe help  of the stick with spear head. A-4 again cut on the\nhead of Kallaperumal (deceased) with his Aruval. A-2 beat on\nP.W's head  with the  cross-stop hour  or five times. P.W. 1\nfell down unconscious. P.W. 7 and others took the injured to\nthe Government\tDispensary Kodavasal. Dr. Radha Singh, Civil\nAssistant Surgeon, P.W. 15 examined Kallaperumal deceased at\n4.55  p.m.   and  issued  a  Wound  Certificate.  Since\t his\ncondition  was\t serious  he  was  sent\t to  the  Government\nHospital, Kumbakonam. P.W.15 examined the injuries or P.W. 1\nat 5.20\t p.m. and  found as  many as  nine injuries  on\t his\nperson. As  already stated  Kaliaperumal died  at about 9.00\np.m. Dr.  N. Jayaraj, P.W. 18 performed the autopsy over the\ndead body.  As many  as 14 injuries were found. The injuries\ngiven on  the head  with Aruval according to the opinions of\nthe Doctors were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\nto cause his death.Various charges  were framed  against the\tsix  accused\nincluding that\tof rioting undersection 147IPC against A-1\nand A-5\t andsection  148against A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6. A-1\nwas further  charged undersections  302/149andsections\n302/109. A-2 to A-6 were charged undersection 302. An extra\ncharge undersection  324was\t levelled  against  A-2\t for\ncausing simple\thurt to\t P.W.  1  with\tthe  cross-stop,  an\ninstrument which had sharp edges. A-6 was also charged undersection 341of the  Penal Code\t for preventing\t P.W. 1 from\nescaping.  The\t accused  denied  their\t complicity  in\t the\noccurrence and\tpleaded not guilty. A-1 took a plea of alibi\nalso and  asserted that\t he had gone to Madras in connection\nwith some  marriage negotiations. Two days after the date of\noccurrence he  was arrested  at Kumbakonam  Railway  Station\nwhen he\t alighted from\tthe train on his return from Madras.\nThe Trial  Judge acquitted  A-1, A-5  and  A-6\tof  all\t the\ncharges. He  convicted A-3  and A-4 undersection 302of the\nPenal Code  and awarded\t a sentence  of life imprisonment to\neach of\t them. They  were  acquitted  of  the  charge  undersection 148. A-2 was convicted only undersection 324with a\nsentence of 4 months' rigorous imprisonment and acquitted of\nall other charges.A-2, A-3 and A-4 preferred an appeal in the Madras High\nCourt against  their conviction\t and the  sentences  imposed\nupon them  by the  Trial Court.\t State preferred  an  appeal\nagainst the  acquittals of  A-1, A-5 and A-6 as also against\nthe acquittal  of A-2  of the  charge undersection 302. It,\nhowever, did  not prefer any appeal against the acquittal of\nA-2, A-3  and A-4  of the  charge undersection 148of the\nPenal Code. Yet it is surprising to find that the High Court\nhas convicted  all the\tsix  accused  for  the\toffences  of\nrioting, A-1  and A-5  undersection  147with\t two  years'\nrigorous imprisonment  and  A-2,  A-3,\tA-4  and  A-6  undersection 148with 3 years' rigorous imprisonment. Conviction\nof A-3\tand A-4\t for the offence of murder undersection 302has been  maintained with  the aid ofsection 34. High Court\nhas also  convicted A-2,  A-5 and  A-6 undersections 302/34a"
